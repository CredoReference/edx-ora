The concentration of ethanol in the liquid will be less than the initial concentration  while the concentration of ethanol in the vapor will be higher than the initial concentration  as defined by the tie-line between the two curves. Collect the vapor  and cool it to condense to yield a higher concentration of ethanol. You can't reach 100% because at equilibrium  the fraction of ethanol in the vapor phase is always less than 1.
0	a) Water and ethanol under certain conditions can form an azeotropic mixture. This is a schematic of their phase diagram which is also known as minimum boiling or positive azeotrope. Starting with a mixture of 15%ethanol - 85% water and by simple distillation we can condense the mixture to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water because at the beginning of the distillation the distillate will be water. 

b) The main characteristic of this mixture is that it s composition is unchanged by distillation when it reaches the minimum boiling point and in this case at approximately 78oC and has a concentration of approximately 95% ethanol and 5% water. Thus  it will continue to boil and produce vapors with constant composition (95% ethanol and 5% water)
0	A water-ethanol solution with 15% ethanol at ~80 degrees Celsius (or slightly more) will have liquid water and vaporous ethanol  since 90 degrees is past the boiling point of water  100 degrees Celsius  and not past the boiling point of ethanol  78.5 degrees Celsius. You can take out the liquid water easily. This could make the solution 60% ethanol. However  it couldn't make it 100% ethanol because the phase diagram shows that once the solution goes past a certain concentration of ethanol  water won't condense anymore. If you lower the temperature  to let the water condense  then the ethanol will also condense. Therefore  the process can only enrich the solution to a point (the eutectic point)  and can't completely remove the water.
0	If the 15% mixture is heated  the resulting vapor will be rich in ethanol. The vapor could then be collected and cooled  forming a liquid that has a higher percentage of ethanol than the original solution.
When a solution containing a high percentage of ethanol is heated the vapor will be of similar composition to the liquid and so further enrichment is not possible.
0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or vice versa  remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's impossible to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.
0	by distillation  and we can not reach 100% because there is a temperature azeotrope
0	As both has different boiling point  solution should heated to change composition. 
0	Raise the temperature of the liquid solution to the liquid and vapor phase. At lower temperatures in the liquid vapor phase  ethanol will have a higher vapor fraction. We can extract the vapor and condense the vapor only to form a richer solution. 

Cannot reach a pure solution  because some water will always be vapor in the region. 
0	Cooling the solution would move the composition along the liquidus to a solution more enriched in enthanol. This procedure will not produce a composition of 100% ethanol as a liquid-vapor eutectic is reached at the minimum temperature on the liquidus  at around 95% ethanol. 
0	Feedback not yet available. Reload to check again. Once the problem is graded  this message will be replaced with the grader's feedback
0	First you have to heat the solution up to 90 and then to lower the temperature to the value of the curve. Thus  the solution will enrich to a composition of 60 percent ethanol-40 percent water  after cooling it. 

You cannot reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an azeotrope. The maximum composition you can reach is the composition in the azeotrope.
0	A.
Heat the liquid to vaporize some  but not all  of it.  Adjust the temperature to balance the amount and composition of the vapor.  Separate and condense the vapor.  If the composition is less than 60% ethanol  repeat using the new liquid.

B.
From the phase diagram (and the lever rule):  Given a liquid composed of less than the critical composition (say 95% ethanol)  the composition of any phase reachable by heating is also less than 95% ethanol.
0	This is a wrong answer.
0	If we were to heat the solution up to 80 degrees C  we could then add ethanol to the solution.  When ethanol concentration hits about 60%  the entire solution will begin to boil.  It is at this point when we will know we have the correct concentration  and may allow it to cool.
We cannot use this procedure to hit 100% ethanol  however  because of the eutectic at about 95%.  We can slowly lessen the temperature and add more ethanol  but once we get to the eutectic  the entire solution either exists as vapor  or as a liquid as both parts.
0	1/ Enrich solution to 60/40
Heat liquid to 80 C max. The vapor generated will be richer in Ethanol than liquid.
At half of vaporization cold the vapor (richer in ethanol than initial liquid). The rest of liquid has less ethanol

Reproduce the process each time with a liquid with higher percentage of ethanol

2/ this process will be limit due to the eutectic point that give a limit of ethanol concentration.
0	As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.

As a mixture with high vapour pressure has a low boiling point: a positive deviation from Raoult's law therefore we infer from the diagram that as the percentage of ethanol increases we see a lower vapour quantity and therefore lower vapour pressure. The molecules would not be able to boil off with the same ease and eventually the liquid and vapour curve would meet at 95.6% ethanol. If the mixture is re-distilled it would have the same concentration of ethanol.
0	may by distillation although this would reach maximum until the eutectic point in the eutectic point would be in the highest concentration possible because after that point generates an equilibrium which is favorable to leggar a higher concentration of the eutectic.

Distillation is the most appropriate means to achieve this concnetracion  for distillation is not possible to achieve 100% since thermodynamically not feasible  since then the eutectic point is not favored these compositions.
0	- increase temperature to vaporize and separate water and the ethanol - distillation process.
- this procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol because both water and ethanol will then evaporate upon reaching a high temp required before the ethanol reaches the 100% composition
0	Heat up the solution of 15% Ethanol - 85% water to beyond 100degrees to get a vapor phase of the 2 components. Then cool down the system to 75 degrees. At this temperature  a solution phase with 60% ethanol - 40% water will be present and this would be in equilibrium with the vapor phase that now contains less % ethanol. 

This procedure cannot be used to get 100% Ethanol because the boiling point of water is higher than Ethanol  or in other words  water will condense at a higher temperature (before ethanol) during the cooling process.

To enrich the solution with water you could heat the solution but when you do that the etanol vaporize.  
0	heating the liquids above the vaporisation temperature and subsequently cooling it at specific temperature will yield higher proportions of ethanol. The procedure may have to repeated in order to form  higher enrichments of ethanol in the solution.

The subsequent heating would require lower temperature for vaporisation as water content would be lowered.
The solution will always contain some amount of water due to the hydrogen bonding with ethanol.
0	You can take the 15/85 composition at temperature of 90 degrees celsium and cool it down to 80 degrees. Then you can have a tie line which will encompass the needed 60/40 composition. Though this procedure can not be used to get 100 ethanol because it can not solute all the water in itself.
0	may by distillation although this would reach maximum until the eutectic point in the eutectic point would be in the highest concentration possible because after that point generates an equilibrium which is favorable to leggar a higher concentration of the eutectic.
0	You have to lower the temperature until around 65 C to get the right ratio. You will not able to get 100% ethanol solution  because lowest line (liquid border) does not reach 100% axis  it reachs only until euthetic point.
0	Because the ethanol mix up with the water and there arent big diferencie between each other

0	The ethanol-water phase diagram given here is of the minimum boiling  positive azeotropic mixture. The azeotropic mixtures on distillation of give the component near to the azeotropic point. The given phase diagram represents a 15% ethanol and 85% water system. 

The method to increase the proportion of ethanol in the system is lowering the temperature. On lowering the temperature  the system moves more towards the azeotropic boiling poing and produces more vapors of ethanol. Another way to improve the purity of ethanol is continuous distillation and on each time  we get purer form of ethanol which is near to the azeotrop. The addition of extra quantity of ethanol to the system can somehow produce ethanol level higher than that of the azeotropic poing but with purity less than that of the original concentration. The addition of a third component like benzene can favour the production of ethanol to high purity up to 99.5%.

It is the important property of azeotrop that the purity of either component cannot be raised  above the azeotropic point  therefore we cannot obtain 100% ethanol from an azeotropic mixture of ethanol-water system

0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's very dufficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.
0	Heat the solution of 15/85 ethanol/water to 101C.  At this point  all of the solution will be vapor.  Cool the vapor to 80C.  At this point  both liquid and vapor phases will be present.  The ethanol and water composition in the vapor phase will be different from that in the liquid phase.  The vapor phase will have a higher concentration of ethanol  due to its lower boiling point compared to water (78.5 C vs 100 C).  Collect the vapor phase and cool it to to condense all of the vapor.  The resulting condensed vapor will be ~60/40 ethanol/water.
Repeating this procedure  heat the resulting 60/40 ethanol/water to > 85C  vaporizing all the material.  Cool the vapor to the liquidus curve.  Collect the vapor and condense.  The resulting mixture will be ~ 90/10 ethanol/water.  Using this method  you will only be able to attain ~ 95/5 ethanol/water.  When the vapor is cooled at this concentration to the liquidus curve  there is no vapor left to collect and purify in the ethanol component. 
0	1. First heat the mixture at 80 deg C and collect the vapor. Now condensate the vapor till all become liquid. The resultant mixture composition will be approximately 60% of ethanol  40% of water. 
0	When vapor is cooled down  it form both liquid and vapor. However  the ethanol content will be higher in vapor than in liquid. As the new vapor phase (with new composition) is separated from the liquid  it can be cooled down to get vapor of higher ethanol purity. The process is repeated until a pure enough ethanol is produced. However  as ethanol purity reaches a certain level  the water-ethanol will form azeotroph. At this point  the composition of vapor and liquid fraction of the mixture will be the same at quilibrium and further process will not shift the composition.
0	Heat the 15% ethanol enough to get into the liquid and vapor region of the phase diagram. The composition of the vapor is given by the right side of the tie line at whatever temperature you are at  and that composition will be greater than 15%.  Physically separate the vapor from the liquid (with a pipe for example)  and then lower the temperature so it condenses.  You now have a liquid at a higher concentration of ethanol than before. Do it again  and the concentration will increase again. Continue until the concentration reaches 60 percent. You can continue this with diminishing returns as you move to the right in the L+V region of the phase diagram. The results diminish because the L+V portion of the phase diagram gets smaller and smaller  so it's hard to have a condition where you have a mix of vapor and liquid  which you need for this scheme to work.   
0	When the solution of 15 percent ethanol-85 percent water is heated (named point A) until around 77~79 degree  it will hit the boiling curve right above point A (named B)  whereby the vapor composition is 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. Draw a line which will join the boiling curve at the right hand side (point C) and the vapor will condense to the liquid curve to get 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (point D  right below point C) at around 70~72 degree Celsius.

This procedure cannot be employed to obtain pure ethanol as this require the mixture to have a zero partial pressure. 
0	By heating the mixture ethanol will concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquid.  Condensing (cooling) appart the enriched mixture in vapor phase will increase ethanol fraction as a liquid mixture.

The procedure could not be used to reach 100% ethanol due to its higher boiling point than a mixture with about 95% ethanol.
0	1.	Concentrating solution is possible by distillation of solution ( moving away is bullocks)
2.	 An eutecticum is here present at 98 %

0	I would use distillation  which is a process used to enrich a mix of two or more liquids with different boiling points. This process consists of heating the mix and then the compound with the lower boiling point will evaporate  separating it from the mix. Using this  you will get a vapor rich in ethanol and a liquid rich in water.

Distillation can not be used to reach a pure composition of 100% ethanol because the mix forms an azeotrope at 96% ethanol (maximum composition of ethanol you can obtain). At this point  the mix behaves like only one component with a boiling point that is lower than that of either component  so you can not separate them. In addition  you can not reach an efficiency of 100% in the process.
0	Heat to the boiling point ~80 degC. Collect the vapor component  lead it to another chamber  cool down and condense.

At ethanol fractions above 95%  the alcohol fraction will instead be reduced by the distillation procedure.
0	
To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.
Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which we can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol.

 
0	A vertical line at the 85 percent water represents the start point.  A horizontal tie line intersects the water liquid to vapor line at the 40 percent water line.  Holding temp and pressure at the 85 percent water line will over time allow more ethanol to turn to liquid than water.  Once the ethanol concentration reaches 60 percent it's rate of evaporation and condensation will be equal.  The water rate of evaporation and condensation will also be equal.   With this method the best you can hope to get is 60 percent ethanol.

0	Heat solution to evaporate ethane (above 80 degrees for 15%  but well below 100 to avoid water to evaporate). Cool down (condese) vapor which will be rich in ethane.

As we evaporate ethane  its concentration lowers and temp has to be increased. As we get closer to 100 degrees  water vapor proportion increases ... not allowing 100% separation.
0	????
0	According to the phase diagram  water and ethanol are miscible liquids. If the solution is currently at room temperature  heating it would cause the apparition of two different phases: a liquid phase  with a higher water molar fraction as temperature increases  and a vapor phase  with also a water molar fraction higher as T increases.
Also  as temperature increases  the relative percentage of the liquid phase decreases as the relative percentage of the vapor phase increases  following the equilibrium lines that conform the phase diagram.
At a certain temperature  the relative percentage of these two phases would reach X% liquid phase and (100-X)% vapor phase; if then we draw an isotherm of this temperature  this line would cut the phase diagram eqilibrium lines: these cut-points represent the composition of each phase (liquid and vapor) coexisting at that temperature.
The solution we want would be the liquid phase at this temperature (which would coexist with a vapor phase)  with a composition of 40%water and 60% ethanol.

To simply find this temperature  select a 60%ethanol 40%water composition and draw a vertical line (isopleth) in the phase diaram. The point at which this vertical line cuts the equilibrium line separating the "vapor" and "liquid+vapor" fields  marks the temperature that is needed to create a solution with the wanted composition.
0	by lowering temperture
0	We should heat up the solution up to about 83 C. At that temperature we'll have some small percent of the liquid gone into vapor. According to the phase diagram that vapor will have about 60% ethanol at that temperature. If we take the vapor out and cool it down somewhere else we'll have the liquid solution of the required ethanol-water composition.

We can't make 100% ethanol using this procedure because after we've got 95% ethanol solution there'll be no increase in it's concentration in the vapor.
0	water and ethanol mixture have the constant lowest boiling point.
when we heat the liquid mixture of water and ethanol the liquid in the botton and the temperature increases. It will be less and less ethanol in it and the gasoline on the top will get cooler  and the percentage of ethanol increase.
after a period of time the liquid contain mostly the water while the gasoline contian about 95% of ethanol and water and ethanol reach the constant boiling point.
so we can not get the pure ethanol gasoline

0	Distillation.  Ethanol has a lower vaporization temperature than water  so you slowly heat the liquid up.  The vapors will be a higher concentration of ethanol than water.  You use a condenser to collect the vapors and turn them back into a liquid.  This is how rum  whiskey  vodka and other hard liquors are made.  You can't go to 100% in one step  because the maximum ethanol content of the vapor is determined by the right boundary of the upper curve  which doesn't go to 100% for any temperature that has a liquid-vapor phase at 15% ethanol.
0	It can be done by partial heating at constant pressure and partially increasing pressure at constant temperature from 15/85 ethanol/water mixture till 60/40 composition is reached.
Because the boiling point of mixture is lower than the individual components   100 percent ethanol cannot be obtained.
0	You'd distill the 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water at about 80 degrees Celsius (as per the tie line) to bring it to 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. The ethanol has a lower boiling point than water  so it's going vaporize more than the water and thus you'd end up with a greater ethanol to water ratio in the distillate. You couldn't get 100% ethanol from this method since the eutectic point is at about 95%  the reason being that a 95 percent ethanol - 5 percent water mixture has a lower boiling point than either pure ethanol or pure water.
0	Heat the 15 percent ethanol solution until it reached the boiling point of approx 80C. The vapors have a composition of approx 60 percent ethanol (the intersection of the horizontal 80C line with the vapor curve). By collecting and condensing those vapors one obtains a solution of 60 percent ethanol.

Successive boil/condense cycles will "converge" to the concentration of the eutectic point at approx 96 percent ethanol.
0	By vaporizing the solution and then cooling it down  the first drops of condensed solution will be richer in water than in ethanol hence the vapor will have a ethanol composition grater than 15%. Repeating this procedure many times it is posible to get a solution over 90% ethanol but not 100% because of the eutheutic. At a fraction greater than the eutheutic composition this procedure will work backwards enriching the solution with water.
0	We follow the regular distillation procedure heating the mixture to increase the percent of water and decrease the percent of ethanol in the liquid phase while the opposite happens in the vapor. We continue until we reach 60% in the vapor what means around 80C in the thermometer place in the vapor. We could continue enrichment until we get the eutectic point. There there is difference between the liquid and vapor composition so i does not matter how long we keep our distillation going  we cannot go farther the 95% of eutectic point.
0	One could distill it down. Decrease temperature and collect ice (e.g. by condensation). Distillation would always reach pure ethanol  since some water would not be mixed into the vapor. 
0	Take a 15% mixture of Ethanol in Water; 
heat the mixture to a temperature where our two substances exist in two distinct different phases - causing the ethanol to change into the vapour phase with the water remaining in fluid phase;
the vapour is now ethanol rich whilst the fluid is water rich - remove some of the water;
now cool the mixture back to entirely fluid phase:
the mixture will now be richer in Ethanol  and if we removed the correct amount of water rich fluid  our mixture will be 60% Ethanol / 40% water.

Why can't we use this method to go the whole way and get 100% Ethanol? 'cos our fluid water & vapour ethanol zone finishes before we get to pure ethanol: meaning that at near 100%ethanol (the Eutectic point) our vapour contains water - the two substances do not exist separately in distinct phases at a single temperature.
0	If you keep the temperature at Ethanol's BP  then the only substance in vapor phase will be the ethanol.   Once you reach the eutectic point  then there will still be too much water vapor in the vapor sample to remove anymore water.  
0	If you cool a 85/15 vapor  then at the liquidus line you will have a higher percent water precipitate out into a liquid.  If you collect the vapor it will have a higher percent ethanol.  You can repeat the process and you will again have a higher percent ethanol.  Effectively you would repeatedly cool and separate the liquid and vapor  with each iteration having a higher percent ethanol vapor and higher percent water liquid.

You could not reach 100 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is below 100 percent.  At that point  when you precipitate out the liquid it will have the same percent ethanol as the vapor.  You are effectively stuck it seems.
0	by fractional destillation; vaporizing the 15%mixture will enrich the vapor in ethanol above 60%  by subsequent cooling of this vapor we will get ethanol at more than 60% 
We cannot reach pure ethanol because ethanol is a azeotrope at about 90% with same composition in liquid as vaporphase so we cannot enrich it above that
0	Enter response here.an increase in temperature and reduction in pressure would enable an enrichment however the 100%solution is not possible due to the limited solubility of the elements
0	None
0	In this phase diagram is an example of that of positive azeotropic mixture  of minimum boiling water ethanol system.  In the diagram  above the locus curve water and ethanol exists as vapor and below the curve both as liquids. The area inside the curve represents an equilibrium mixture of both. If we plot a tie line in the centre we will get a 50-50 mixture of both components. The distillation of this mixture will produce the product closer in proportion of the component near the azeotrop  which is ethanol here. 

In the given sample and at the given temperature  represents a 15% ethanol and 85% water system. It can be enriched in ethanol by reducing the temperature to the required level. On lower temperature  the tie line indicates higher proportion if ethanol and lower proportion of water. On lowering the temperature  the tie line moves to right giving more ethanol from in the vapor phase.  Continuous distillations can lead to ethanol of purity near to azeotrop but not higher than that. If we add more ethanol to the system  the resulting solution will contain ethanol slightly higher than the azeotrop  but poorer in purity than the original solution  leaving more ethanol in solution. 

Another way to increase the purity of the components distilled at the azeotropic point is the addition of a third component to shift the equilibrium point. For example  to the azeotropic boiling solution at 78C  which distills as 96% ethanol and 4% water  the addition of the third component benzene can remove the water leading to 99.5% pure ethanol. 

In the case of azeotropic mixtures it is not possible to purify the component above the azeotropic point  therefore we cannot obtain 100% ethanol from an azeotropic mixture of ethanol-water system

0	The temperature range of the phase alpha of the solution of 60 percent ethanol is lower than the solution of 15 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is near.
This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an eutectic point for 95 percent ethanol.
0	One could change the composition from 15% ethanol - 80% water to 60% ethanol - 40% water by lowering the temperature. These two evaporate at different temperatures  water at 100 Celsius and  ethanol at 78.5 Celsius (according to the diagram)  so to be able to reach a 100% pure ethanol would be needed water to evaporate at a lower temperature that ethanol. We have an eutectic point at 95% ethanol.
0	Let's assume first the solution is at room temperature.
Heat up solution to 90 degrees. The solution starts to evaporate but more water than ethanol evaporates. Cool down the solution. The ethanol concentration has increased.
Repeat the heat up - cool down cycle until ethanol concentration reaches 60 percent.
Ethanol concentration cannot reach 100% because when the solution evaporates both water and ethanol evaporates. It is not possible to evaporate water only.
0	heat up to 85C approximately  since that's where liquid is in equilibrium w/60% vapor. capture vapor.
you could then condense vapor and heat again to about 65C to get to eutectic composition.
once there though you can't heat and get a mixture of phases to work with. so you can't get purer than eutectic composition.


0	Enter response a distillate containing 85% of ethanol in the collecting flask (provided you are careful with the temperature control  and the fractionating column is long enough);

pure water in the boiling flask.




0	We have to cool the solution down. At about 70 degrees the solution is of approximately desired composition  as the liquidus line at this temperature indicates. However  further cooling will only lead to freezing of both components (at the eutectic).
0	One could enrich the solution by cooling the solution to 80 degrees so that the tie line roughly connects the 15% ethanol and the 60% ethanol solutions which means that the solid formed by cooling the 15% solution to 80 degrees will have a larger composition (60%) of ethanol. One can't reach a pure ethanol composition because there is no tie line temperature that you can cool the solution to that will give a 100- percent solution.
0	1. First heat the mixture at 80 deg C and collect the vapor. Now condensate the vapor till all become liquid. The resultant mixture composition will be approximately 60% of ethanol  40% of water. 

2. The repeated process will result in a mixture closer to azeotropic ratio (95% Ethanol: 5% Water). The composition can not be altered further by distillation process.

0	Vaporize the given solution and bring the temperature to around 90 degrees Celsius.  Now a 60% sample of ethanol will exist in the vapor.  The liquid that will be created will be of a smaller concentration of ethanol and greater concentration of water.  The liquid can be removed and then the vapor can be condensed.  The condensed vapor can then be vaporized again  and slowly brought down to another temperature within the elliptic overlap.  A pure composition of 100% ethanol is impossible because of the jump that occurs at the right of the graph.  The purest that the sample can be is ~95% ethanol.  
0	We're starting with a 15% Ethanol solution  which assumes a liquid phase. Change the temperature (higher) toward the water liquid / vapor equilibrium. When this equilibrium point is reached the water component starts to become a vapor and water content is reduced. To continue reducing the water content it is now necessary to reduce temperature slowly. As the temperature is reduced  more water content will be vaporized and the goal of a 60% Ethanol solution will be reached.

When the solution becomes sufficiently enriched there is insufficient water content to continue vaporizing the water and the vaporization of water stops. Chilling further would not enrich the solution  it would just turn more fulling into the liquid phase.
0	When we have a solution of 15 percent ethanol to enrich at 60 percent of ethanol is needed make distillation by heating the solution between 80 and 90 degrees C for a some time.  This procedure could not be used to reach at 100 percent ethanol because when as the solution is purified have the phase graph change and the boiling point of the solution becomes lesser.
0	First heating to about 80  C and then cooling to 60  C.
Since it could not produce a fixed eutectic composition.
0	The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. This resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.

From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%.

0	If you heat a liquid solution of 15% ethanol + 80% water from room temperature to 85 degrees  you will get a vapour phase of 60% ethanol + 40% water and a liquid phase of 8% ethanol + 92% water.

The maximum purity of ethanol that could be produced using this procedure is 95%
0	Distillation.
We could just heat the liquid 15% mixture to above 80 % to have a liquid-vapor mixture. The vapor would have a higher composition in ethanol than the liquid. This vapor could be condensed appart from the liquid to have a more concentrate liquid.
Due to the shape of the curve  it is difficult to have a significant amount of vapor of 60% directly from 15%. If we go to the liquidus curve (bubble point) and see the concentration of the vapor it would be around 60% but the production would be almost 0. A solution to this would be generate a higher amount of less concentrated vapor (let's say 40% with T=90 C aprox)  condense it and repeat the process taking advantage of how the curvature of the liquidus changes.

It is not possible to reach a 100% of purity because of the point around 96% in which the liquid and vapor have the same composition. If we reach that point by the previous distillation method  in the next step  the vapor and the liquid would have exactly the same composition  so it is impossible to enrich any of the phases. This point is called an azeotrope.
0	Heat the liquid above the boiling point of ethanol and catch the vapor in a collection container and allow it to cool.  Since the ethanol will vaporize first  the solution that you catch in the container will have a higher ethanol percentage.  You can't get 100% because some water will always be present in the collection container.
0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's very difficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.  In addition  the eutectic point forbid us to collect vapor with a higher concentration of ethanol using this method past a certain point.
0	Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C.
Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution.
0	You start heating up a solution of 15% ethanol in water. At 80C approx. you will enter the two phase lenticular zone  you will enter equilibrium. That equilibrium will have a liquid phase  with a concentration of ethanol sligthly lower than 15%. And a vapor phase at around 60% ethanol concentration. If you let out  by distillation  that vapor and let it condense  it will be a liquid phase with around 60% ethanol concentration. 

There is no way to reach a 100% ethanol concentration in the vapor phase. 
0	Enter response here.Here we can make the composition of  ethanol large by boiling the solution and then condense it. Then again boil it and condense it.By doing this the concentration of ethanol increases in the condensed solution as ethanol is more volatile. Here we can't make 100% ethanol solution as there is some water present in the vapor.
0	One could bring the solution to about the condensation temperature range  between 80 degrees and 100 degrees  and then proceed to add ethanol to the mix until the desired fraction is reached  always keeping the temperature of the mixture in the condensation range  then bring the temperature back down until the solution is liquid again. This cannot bring the solution 100% ethanol  due to the eutectic occurring in the middle of the diagram  as soon as the composition reaches this eutectic it will either fall into the liquid or vapor area  and will not be able to incorporate any more ethanol into the solution.
0	When the 15% ethanol is heated above 80 degrees the mixture will enter the vapor phase.  While in the vapor phase the water will more readily condense out than the ethanol yielding a vapor phase enriched in ethanol.  If held at about 80 degrees the ethanol will continue to be enriched to about 60%.  This vapor can be taken off and condensed to give a liquid that is 60% ethanol.  This enriching process can continue by distillation so long as the lens curve is going down.  Above about 95% the lens curve goes up so the vapor will be enriched in water in that part of the graph so further purifying of the ethanol cannot be accomplished.
0	Heat solution to evaporate ethane (above 80 degrees for 15%  but well below 100 to avoid water to evaporate). Cool down (condese) vapor which will be rich in ethane.

As we evaporate ethane  its concentration lowers and temp has to be increased. As we get closer to 100  water vapor increases ... not allowing 100 separation.
0	Heat up 15% solution to 90 degrees C and delete all liquid. You will get vapor with 40% ethanol fraction. Then cool this vapor to 80 degrees C and delete all condensed liquid again. The resulting vapor will consist 60 % of ethanol and 40 % of water. Then condense it and get a liquid solution with 60 % of ethanol and 40 % of water.
This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because of eutectic point. In this point you have 97 % of ethanol. If you will heat up this 97% ethanol solution all solution will vaporize without L+V phase. You couldn't divide this solution by condensing and vaporizing. Every time you will get the same 97% ethanol fraction.
0	Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Not all the ethanol can be extracted this way though  as at around 95% ethanol the mixture goes straight from the combined liquid phase to a combined gaseous phase.
0	Heating the mixture at a point above 78.5oC but below 81oC will result in a mixture of water vapour where some particles have sufficient energy to evaporate and ethanol vapour. This point is lower than the point at which all water turns to vapour with a 60/40% split.  All the ethanol should evaporate before all of the water. Extracting the gas from this should allow any composition of ethanol to be formed upto 96%. This is because at the point where ethanol evaporates  some water will evaporate and then recondense with the ethanol to form the maximum concentration of ethanol.
0	From the diagram the top line on the left hand side is not marked as water or ethanol  but I assume it must be water as ethanol has a lower boiling point. If you boiled the mixture  the water part would only just be turning to gas  but there would be more of the ethanol as gas as that would have started getting enough energy to be a gas for a longer time - so the vapour coming off would be more ethanol - somehow you could catch that somewhere else  and end up with more ethanol in that mixture.

You probably couldn't get 100% ethanol because as you got closer to the eutectic point  the mixture would boil off and the vapour would actually tend to be lower in ethanol than you wanted (or the same constant 95% or whatever it is)  and you couldn't get it any higher this way.
0	By increasing the temperature you could increase the volume of the ethanol faster than the water  and thus you are able to get a 60:40 percent concentration. However  no matter how much you heat it  there will still be some water in the ethanol and it will never be pure
0	The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. The resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.

From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%. Additionally  at a concentration of ~95% ethanol  the phase diagram shows an eutectic  meaning both components transition to vapor at the same temperature point. Hence  no further gains in concentration are possible beyond ~95%.

0	The desired composition can be reached by following a distillation procedure where the 15/85 mixture is heated to a temperature that will support two phases simultaneously - liquid water together with a vapor that is a water-ethanol mix with a higher concentration of ethanol than the original 15/85 mixture.  The distillation temperature needs to be below the bottom boundary of the vapor phase and above the upper boundary of the liquid phase; referring to the phase diagram the horizontal line representing the appropriate temperature should intercept the vapor line where that line intercepts the vertical line for a 40/60 water/ethanol mix - i.e.  roughly 82 degrees C.  If the vapor mix is then drawn off and cooled to a point where it enters the liquid phase of the diagram  a condensate with the desired 40/60 mix should result.

To further increase the proportion of ethanol  it is necessary to move further to the right on the phase diagram  which (due to the downward slope of the vapor line) means that the distillation temperature must be reduced.  However  from the diagram the lowest usable temperature will only produce an ethanol concentration of about 95% - reducing the temperature further will keep the mixture entirely within the liquid phase  rendering distillation impossible.


0	In order to get drunker quicker
Slowly  subtly heat the liquor.
Steamy booze is really great
But sup upon the condensate.
Still  200 proof is beyond hope 
Alas for cursed azeotrope!
No further reward for constant toiling
As ethanol/water is unchanged on boiling.
0	Heat the solution until vapour forms. At this point we have a vapour mixutre of water and ethanol.  Cooling the liquid and collecting the condensation will collect more water as it liquifies at a higher temperature  thus the remaining solution will have reduced water content.  Once the solution is about 95% ethanol this procedure won't work because the ethanol will also be distilled out.
0	Condensing a vapor made from the initial solution could produce rich ethanol.
The procedure could not be used to reach pure 100% ethanol because some water would evaporate along with it because of their BP difference.

0	It is necessary to heat the initial solution to the boiling point and lead the process of boiling until the steam will condense at the ~80 C.

Azeotrope of water and ethanol contains 96% of ethanol and boils at 78 C. This explains the industrial concentration of ethyl alcohol: this is an azeotrope and it can not be divided into fractions by simple distillation.
0	Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C. There will be an equilibrium of a liquid (~10:90) and a vapor (~60:40).
Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution. If the distillation resulted in lower ethanol content in the collected solution  distillation should be repeated from the enriched solution until we get the appropriate composition.
0	blablabla
0	As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.
