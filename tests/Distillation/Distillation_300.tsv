0	To do this  it is necessary to cool the solution  which contains 15% ethanol and 85% water  from 79 C to 70 5 C.

Azeotrope of water and ethanol contains 96% of ethanol and boils at 78 C. This explains the industrial concentration of ethyl alcohol: this is an azeotrope and it can not be divided into fractions by simple distillation.
0	by fractional destillation; vaporizing the 15%mixture will enrich the vapor in ethanol above 60%  by subsequent cooling of this vapor we will get ethanol at more than 60% 
We cannot reach pure ethanol because ethanol is a azeotrope at about 90% with same composition in liquid as vaporphase so we cannot enrich it above that
0	Heat the mixture to above ethanol boiling point but below water boiling point. Collect the vapor. It will be mostly ethanol.
0	Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C. There will be an equilibrium of a liquid (~10:90) and a vapor (~60:40).
Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution. If the distillation resulted in lower ethanol content in the collected solution  distillation should be repeated from the enriched solution until we get the appropriate composition.
0	As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.
0	boiling at around 80 deg C will give more ethanol vapors and less water vapor so that condensing these vapours will give more ethanol and less water.

because it forms a eutectic at around 0.95 fraction ethanol and at less than the boiling point of ethanol (i.e. 78.5 deg C)  this procedure will not reach 100 percent ethanol. vapour formation would be with five percent water at 80 deg C
0	You start heating up a solution of 15% ethanol in water. At 80C approx. you will enter the two phase lenticular zone  you will enter equilibrium. That equilibrium will have a liquid phase  with a concentration of ethanol sligthly lower than 15%. And a vapor phase at around 60% ethanol concentration. If you let out  by distillation  that vapor and let it condense  it will be a liquid phase with around 60% ethanol concentration. 

There is no way to reach a 100% ethanol concentration in the vapor phase. 
0	By heating the solution to a point higher than liquidus line  one can have vapor phase enriched by ethanol in higher temperature ( this temperature is chosen by the final composition). by separating Vapor phase from liquid phase and cooling this vapor to room temperature  one can have enriched solution. by this procedure  the pure ethanol never can be reached because for more ethanol concentration we must heat closer to liquidus line  and on liquidus line in the initial concentration  the maximum concentration of ethanol is less than 100.
0	Enter response here.    Water & Ethanol is an example of non-ideal mixture with positive deviation having ethanol less boiling point.When the solution is kept in equilibrium with its vapor phase the vapor is richer in more ethanol(as ethanol is more volatile than water).Then the vapor is condensed to form the first distillate & this distillate is kept in equilibrium with its vapor.Again the vapor is condensed & this process is continued to get our final composition.By doing this process again & again the distillate produces pure more volatile component in the final distillate & pure less volatile component in the residue. By using this procedure i can't reach a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol as further distillation decreases the percentage of water in given solution but it can't make it zero as some water is present in vapor phase.
0	Heating the solution it will boil yielding a liquid and a vapor in equilibrium.  The vapor can be condensed by cooling yielding a liquid of about the required concentration.  Restricting the flow of vapor so that there is a temperature gradient and some of the vapor can condense and run back into the solution  the distillation process can produce higher concentrations of ethanol.
Ethanol and water form an azeotrope  a constant boiling mixture  which boils at a lower temperature than pure ethanol as can be seen from the phase diagram.  Absolute alcohol cannot be produced by distillation.
N.B. As the density of ethanol is less than water percentages need to state whether by weight  volume or other basis.  Here weight is assumed although volume is more common in a commercial context.
N.B. Some methods of producing absolute alcohol leave traces of other substances e.g. benzene making the product unsuitable for human consumption and it cannot be used in the production of fortified wines.    
0	Iwould be able to get a richer composition of ethanol by applying a disproportionation process.
at a  distillation procedure you reach a point when it is impossible to obtain 100% pure ethanol because of the formation of an azeotrope. 
0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's very dufficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.
0	Enter response a distillate containing 85% of ethanol in the collecting flask (provided you are careful with the temperature control  and the fractionating column is long enough);

pure water in the boiling flask.




0	Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Not all the ethanol can be extracted this way though  as at around 95% ethanol the mixture goes straight from the combined liquid phase to a combined gaseous phase.
0	On the diagram we see that at higher percent volume of ethanol the solution has lower temperature of vaporization. At 15% ethanol  we have larger vaporization distance (around 100-80=20 degrees)  but at higher percents this distance will be shorter. Maybe we have to heat up the 15%-mixture to temperature around 90-95 C  so the water and ethanol will evaporate (maybe even boil)  then cool the vapor down  and the condensated liquid will have larger concentration of the ethanol. But this will not work after 80-90% of ethanol because the border liquid-gas on the diagram will be too close to eutectic  and after 95% ethanol will evaporate permanently thus decreasing own concentration.
0	Enriching a solution of ethanol and water is straight forwards by heating the solution to a 2 phase mixture and separating out the vapor. This vapor will be a higher fractional ethanol if allowed to condense the solution formed should be roughly 60% ethanol from a 15% feed. This can be continued up to the azeotrope at 95 ish % where the vapor  and liquid are in equilibrium at this point we would need to vary pressure or introduce additives to break the azeotrope and refine the solution higher. 
0	Heating the mixture at a point above 78.5oC but below 81oC will result in a mixture of water vapour where some particles have sufficient energy to evaporate and ethanol vapour. This point is lower than the point at which all water turns to vapour with a 60/40% split.  All the ethanol should evaporate before all of the water. Extracting the gas from this should allow any composition of ethanol to be formed upto 96%. This is because at the point where ethanol evaporates  some water will evaporate and then recondense with the ethanol to form the maximum concentration of ethanol.
0	When vapor is cooled down  it form both liquid and vapor. However  the ethanol content will be higher in vapor than in liquid. As the new vapor phase (with new composition) is separated from the liquid  it can be cooled down to get vapor of higher ethanol purity. The process is repeated until a pure enough ethanol is produced. However  as ethanol purity reaches a certain level  the water-ethanol will form azeotroph. At this point  the composition of vapor and liquid fraction of the mixture will be the same at quilibrium and further process will not shift the composition.
0	Enter response here.a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water
0	Condense vapor by cooling.
The Eutectic falls at around 95% ethanol  which is the maximum percentage of ethanol you could expect to get from cooling.
0	The water will boil away more readily than the ethanol  increasing the ethanol concentration of the solution. However  after a point  the ethanol will evaporate more readily than the water. The highest possible concentration is where the two teardrops meet each other.
0	We can cool the solution down until we get the required composition. Also 100% ethanol is not possible because the boiling point of water is greater than ethanol  thus there will be water in the solution.
0	As we know that water / ethanol form an azeotrope Which Is the combination (in this case) of 95.63% ethanol/4.37% H2O and it has a LOWER boiling point (78.2C) Either than H2O (at 100C) or pure ethanol (78.4C). Therefore  in a simple distillation  you get the azeotrope (lower boiling point) coming over. Anhydrous ethanol is made by adding benzene  cyclohexane  toluene  (or some others) to the azeotrope and distilling. The added component modifies the boiling point such pure ethanol That can be obtained. Ethanol / water is a combination with a lower boiling point; HCl/H2O form an azeotrope that is a higher boliling point. HCl 20.2% / 79.8% H2 O boils at 110  C and not -84 (HCl) or 100 (H2O).
0	By heating the solution over its boiling point  some vapor will be released. The vapor will have a much higher concentration of ethanol. A solution could be obtained by extracting the vapor and letting it cool back to the liquid phase. The concentration of the resulting solution would depend on the actual curves in the phase diagram. In this case  for a solution with 15% ethanol  the tie line indicates that vapor with approximately 65% ethanol will be released at the beginning of boiling.
By repeating this process  solutions with increased concentrations of ethanol can be obtained. However  the phase diagram shows that it is not possible to obtain concentrations of ethanol higher than approximately 95%. At this concentration the solution behaves like a pure substance  and ethanol concentration in the vapor is the same as in the liquid.
0	From the diagram I can see that for temperatures around 90 degrees  the liquid phase is mostly water. In particular the concentration of ethanol in the liquid phase seems to be significantly less than 15%.

So I could heat the solution to 90 degrees then remove the liquid  and then cool the vapor to obtain a higher % ethanol liquid. I could repeat this process several times.

I cannot enrich the solution indefinitely in this way for the following reasons:

Looking at the right side of the diagram  I see that eventually there comes a point when there are no mixed phases anymore. 
Also  to the far right  it looks like the ethanol has a higher concentration in the vapor phase than in the liquid phase.
0	In a closed container heat up the 15%-ethanol solution enough so that we move up from the region of liquid to the region of liquid + vapor. The composition of the vapor is given by moving to the right along a tie-line; it will be richer in ethanol. Remove the now ethanol-poor liquid and cool the vapor to get a liquid with a higher percentage of ethanol. It so happens that there is a tie-line connecting a little less than 15% to 60%  so we could heat to a minimum temperature and in one step get a very small amount of 60% solution. But in general we can't expect to do this. We would heat to a higher temperature and obtain sub-60% ethanol liquid and then repeat the procedure. This procedure "lives"  so to speak  in the liquid + vapor lens that is to the left of the minimum point of the bounding curves at 95% ethanol. So we can never get 100% ethanol.
0	If the temperature is brought to just above 80 degrees  the vapor composition will be approximately 60 percent ethanol. This vapor can be captured for the desired solution.

This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because for a fraction of 15 percent ethanol solution  the vapor composition will never reach 100 percent.
0	
To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.
Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which we can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol.

 
0	Heat the solution of 15/85 ethanol/water to 101C.  At this point  all of the solution will be vapor.  Cool the vapor to 80C.  At this point  both liquid and vapor phases will be present.  The ethanol and water composition in the vapor phase will be different from that in the liquid phase.  The vapor phase will have a higher concentration of ethanol  due to its lower boiling point compared to water (78.5 C vs 100 C).  Collect the vapor phase and cool it to to condense all of the vapor.  The resulting condensed vapor will be ~60/40 ethanol/water.
Repeating this procedure  heat the resulting 60/40 ethanol/water to > 85C  vaporizing all the material.  Cool the vapor to the liquidus curve.  Collect the vapor and condense.  The resulting mixture will be ~ 90/10 ethanol/water.  Using this method  you will only be able to attain ~ 95/5 ethanol/water.  When the vapor is cooled at this concentration to the liquidus curve  there is no vapor left to collect and purify in the ethanol component. 
0	Since the final solution has a stronger concentration of ethanol  we have add additional ethanol to the mixture. This procedure will never reach a composition of 100 percent ethanol because there will always be some water from the original mixture.
0	According to the phase diagram  water and ethanol are miscible liquids. If the solution is currently at room temperature  heating it would cause the apparition of two different phases: a liquid phase  with a higher water molar fraction as temperature increases  and a vapor phase  with also a water molar fraction higher as T increases.
Also  as temperature increases  the relative percentage of the liquid phase decreases as the relative percentage of the vapor phase increases  following the equilibrium lines that conform the phase diagram.
At a certain temperature  the relative percentage of these two phases would reach X% liquid phase and (100-X)% vapor phase; if then we draw an isotherm of this temperature  this line would cut the phase diagram eqilibrium lines: these cut-points represent the composition of each phase (liquid and vapor) coexisting at that temperature.
The solution we want would be the liquid phase at this temperature (which would coexist with a vapor phase)  with a composition of 40%water and 60% ethanol.

To simply find this temperature  select a 60%ethanol 40%water composition and draw a vertical line (isopleth) in the phase diaram. The point at which this vertical line cuts the equilibrium line separating the "vapor" and "liquid+vapor" fields  marks the temperature that is needed to create a solution with the wanted composition.
0	heating the liquids above the vaporisation temperature and subsequently cooling it at specific temperature will yield higher proportions of ethanol. The procedure may have to repeated in order to form  higher enrichments of ethanol in the solution.

The subsequent heating would require lower temperature for vaporisation as water content would be lowered.
The solution will always contain some amount of water due to the hydrogen bonding with ethanol.
0	When the 15% ethanol is heated above 80 degrees the mixture will enter the vapor phase.  While in the vapor phase the water will more readily condense out than the ethanol yielding a vapor phase enriched in ethanol.  If held at about 80 degrees the ethanol will continue to be enriched to about 60%.  This vapor can be taken off and condensed to give a liquid that is 60% ethanol.  This enriching process can continue by distillation so long as the lens curve is going down.  Above about 95% the lens curve goes up so the vapor will be enriched in water in that part of the graph so further purifying of the ethanol cannot be accomplished.
0	First heating to about 80  C and then cooling to 60  C.
Since it could not produce a fixed eutectic composition.
0	First  vaporize the mixture. Latrer Cold it down to about 80 degrees. The remanentes liquid will be water  to be retired. Now  if you cool the vapor to room temperature the solution will contain about the 65 percent of ethanol. 
0	We can read off the phase diagram that as we heat a solution of water and 15% ethanol  the liquid will separate into ethanol-rich vapor and water-rich liquid - disproportionation. As we increase the temperature  more of the water will vaporize as well  and eventually the whole solution will vaporize. So in order to vaporize more ethanol and less water  the temperature has to be just right.

We want a composition of 60% ethanol and 40% water. When the solution is heated to a little over 80 degrees  the vapor yields precisely that composition. So if we heat the solution to that temperature  gather  the vapor  then separate the vapor from the liquid and let the vapor cool  we will have the solution we were looking for.

This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 % ethanol  however. Because  as we can see on the phase diagram  any solution of water and ethanol with less than ~95% ethanol  will not yield vapor with more than ~95% ethanol at any temperature. If the original composition is only 15% ethanol  the moment any vapor begins to form it is not of much more than 60% ethanol composition - and any higher temperature will yield less ethanol - so it's impossible to get pure ethanol.
0	One could enrich the solution by cooling the solution to 80 degrees so that the tie line roughly connects the 15% ethanol and the 60% ethanol solutions which means that the solid formed by cooling the 15% solution to 80 degrees will have a larger composition (60%) of ethanol. One can't reach a pure ethanol composition because there is no tie line temperature that you can cool the solution to that will give a 100- percent solution.
0	????
0	Enter response here. Slowly raise the temperature above the boiling point of ethanol  but below the boiling point of water. At this point we have two phases: liquid and vapor at equilibrium. The concentration of ethanol in the liquid will be less than the initial concentration  while the concentration of ethanol in the vapor will be higher than the initial concentration  as defined by the tie-line between the two curves. Collect the vapor  and cool it to condense to yield a higher concentration of ethanol. You can't reach 100% because at equilibrium  the fraction of ethanol in the vapor phase is always less than 1.
0	We assume we are at constant pressure:
- The solution is heated  the  vapor is extracted and condensed. The liquid condensate is richer in the more volatile component than the original liquid  ethanol in our case. 
- This new solution is again heated  the vapor is extracted and condense once again.
- The process continues until we reach the solution with the target composition.
This type of distillation is called fractional distillation.
With this method we only reach a 95% ethanol solution. That is because water and ethanol form a solution called azeotrope.
The azeotropes are solution of two or more components  whose proportions are such that the vapor produced by partial evaporation has the same composition as the liquid. When a solution is at the point of the azeotrope   this mixture can not be distillable or separated into its components.
0	The temperature range of the phase alpha of the solution of 60 percent ethanol is lower than the solution of 15 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is near.
This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an eutectic point for 95 percent ethanol.
0	One could increase the concentration of ethanol by inreasing the temperature -- in order to go from liquid to a vapor phase. It is not possible to reach a composition of 100 percent ethanol because then  liquid and gas would have to exist at same time; this is not possible. 
0	A method called multistage distillation can be applied  in which  vapor is contacted with liquid fraction to reach equilibriium. Since vapor will contain larger fraction of ethanol  it can be cooled down to get vapor of higher ethanol purity. The process is repeated until a pure enough ethanol is produced. However  as ethanol purity reaches a certain level  the water-ethanol will form azeotroph. At this point  the composition of vapor and liquid fraction of the mixture will be the same and further process will not shift the composition.
0	Cooling the solution would move the composition along the liquidus to a solution more enriched in enthanol. This procedure will not produce a composition of 100% ethanol as a liquid-vapor eutectic is reached at the minimum temperature on the liquidus  at around 95% ethanol. 
0	You heat the 15/85 solution. At approximatively 80  according to the bottom line of the diagram  the solution will start to boil. The vapor generated will contain around 60% of ethanol (intersection of the 80 tie line with the top curve). If we cool the vapor  it will condensate and become a liquid with 60% of ethanol. If we repeat this procedure  each time we will progress on the tie line towards the right of the phase diagram  until we reach the point where the two curves intersect (the azeotrope) and the vapor has the same composition as the liquid (around 95/5).
0	You could raise the temperature to under 100 degrees C  and  condense the ethanol vapor.
The reason why you couldn't get to 100% is that water and ethanol dissolve in each other  so there would be some carryover.   
0	Vaporize the liquid completely  then lower the temperature.  Liquid begins to form at the low ethanol concentration end of the diagram.  This will be mostly water.  Draw it off  then continue condensation.  This later (lower temperature) condensate will be occurring at the high ethanol end of the diagram.  By repeating the process  the mixture can be enriched to the point of lowest condensation temperature  at over 95% ethanol  but not above. 
0	If you heat a liquid solution of 15% ethanol + 80% water from room temperature to 85 degrees  you will get a vapour phase of 60% ethanol + 40% water and a liquid phase of 8% ethanol + 92% water.

The maximum purity of ethanol that could be produced using this procedure is 95%
0	One could bring the solution to about the condensation temperature range  between 80 degrees and 100 degrees  and then proceed to add ethanol to the mix until the desired fraction is reached  always keeping the temperature of the mixture in the condensation range  then bring the temperature back down until the solution is liquid again. This cannot bring the solution 100% ethanol  due to the eutectic occurring in the middle of the diagram  as soon as the composition reaches this eutectic it will either fall into the liquid or vapor area  and will not be able to incorporate any more ethanol into the solution.
0	Take a 15% mixture of Ethanol in Water; 
heat the mixture to a temperature where our two substances exist in two distinct different phases - causing the ethanol to change into the vapour phase with the water remaining in fluid phase;
the vapour is now ethanol rich whilst the fluid is water rich - remove some of the water;
now cool the mixture back to entirely fluid phase:
the mixture will now be richer in Ethanol  and if we removed the correct amount of water rich fluid  our mixture will be 60% Ethanol / 40% water.

Why can't we use this method to go the whole way and get 100% Ethanol? 'cos our fluid water & vapour ethanol zone finishes before we get to pure ethanol: meaning that at near 100%ethanol (the Eutectic point) our vapour contains water - the two substances do not exist separately in distinct phases at a single temperature.
0	Boil the solution over 100C and then let it cool to 85C. The liquid phase that appears will be rich in water while the remaining vapor will be richer in ethanol. Eliminate the liquid and cool down the vapor until it is completely liquid. It will be 60% ethanol.
You cannot reach pure ethanol  because this procedure can only go as far as the eutectic. Indeed  starting from the left of the eutectic  the phases will be mixtures of pure water and the eutectic.
0	Heat solution to evaporate ethane (above 80 degrees for 15%  but well below 100 to avoid water to evaporate). Cool down (condese) vapor which will be rich in ethane.

As we evaporate ethane  its concentration lowers and temp has to be increased. As we get closer to 100  water vapor increases ... not allowing 100 separation.
0	As the solution is heated above about 80 C  it moves into a phase that involves vapor and liquid water.  If the temperature is kept just at the point where vaporization begins  the ethanol content of the vapor will be right around 60%.

If the solution is not heated to that temperature  no vaporization will occur; and if it is heated to a higher temperature  the ethanol content of the vapor will be lower.  Therefore 60% is about the best ethanol content that can be achieved through this process.
0	Heat the liquid above the boiling point of ethanol and catch the vapor in a collection container and allow it to cool.  Since the ethanol will vaporize first  the solution that you catch in the container will have a higher ethanol percentage.  You can't get 100% because some water will always be present in the collection container.
0	Temperature should be elevated . There will be an equilibrium of liquid and vapor.
Vapor should be cooled and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution. If the distillation resulted in lower ethanol content in the collected solution  distillation should be repeated from the enriched solution until we get the appropriate composition.
0	By destillation. The destillation is richer in ethanol than the previous liquid.
It's impossible to separate water from ethanol by destillation because this system has an eutectic point.
0	If you cool a vapor of 15% ethanol  85% water  It'll start to condense into a liquid just below 100 degrees. But the water will condense first  so the vapor will be disproportionally ethanol.  You can't get to 100% ethanol that way  because at about 95% ethanol and 70 degrees or so  all the vapor will liquefy.
0	The simplest method is to separate the components  at least partially. One can for example distill the ethanol from the solution in a distiller. What vaporizes is a mixture of water and ethanol  which condensed in the condenser making up a solution of higher concentration of ethanol since it vaporizes usually much faster (and in bigger amounts in a given period of time) than water.
The pure ethanol cannot be produced in the process of distillation as at some concentration  the liquid solution vaporizes directly inty the vapor solution as a whole  which means that concentration in both liquid and vapor no longer changes.
0	For fractions of ethanol less than about 0.95  the phase diagram contains a region of liquid water + vapor. This liquid water can be discarded  and the vapor of water and ethanol condensed into an enriched solution. The process can be repeated as necessary. For ethanol fractions of greater than about 0.95  the intermediate region of the phase diagram corresponds to liquid ethanol plus vapor  so no further enrichment is possible by the same procedure.

0	In a closed container heat up the 15%-ethanol solution enough so that we move up from the region of liquid to the region of liquid + vapor. The composition of the vapor is given by moving to the right along a tie-line; it will be richer in ethanol. Remove the now ethanol-poor liquid and cool the vapor to get a liquid with a higher percentage of ethanol. It so happens that there is a tie-line connecting a little less than 15% to 60%  so we could heat to a minimum temperature and in one step get a very small amount of 60% solution. But in general we can't expect to do this. We would heat to a higher temperature and obtain sub-60% ethanol liquid and then repeat the procedure. This procedure "lives"  so to speak  in the liquid + vapor lens that is to the left of the eutectic point at 95% ethanol. So we can never get 100% ethanol.
0	Starting off with the solution with 15% ethanol and heating it until reaching the liquidus line in the phase diagram  the vapour phase will be much richer in ethanol than the liquid phase. By condensing the vapour phase  the "newly obtained" liquid phase is much richer in ethanol than the previous. This process can be repeated to obtain solutions with increasing ethanol content up until we reach the eutectic point in the phase diagram. At this point  both vapour and liquid phases contain the same ethanol percent  which means that no further "purification" of ethanol is achieved by this process.
0	Tie line at 80 temperature   gives 15 to 65 (approx) percent ethanol range and for 60  % ethanol. Lever rule   gives vapor fraction = 0.9 and liquid fraction 0.1. 

At particular temperature (approx 65 ) there is direct vapor to liquid transformation that gives at about 95 % ethanol by distillation process. Further   again there is binary solution to reach 100. So it can not give 100 percent pure ethanol.
0	Raise the temperature of the mixture into the phase region
which contains both liquid water and vapor (mixture) - above
the liquidus.

Maintain temperature on that tie line while the vapor 
fraction naturally increases (due to preferential vaporization
of ethanol) until a new equilibrium is attain at the vapor
boundary on the diagram. The fraction ethanol in the vapor
is indicated by the X-axis value at the intersection of the 
temperature and the vapor boundary. I.e. this value is
dependent on the desired final composition. This process
can be repeated (after condensing and collecting the vapor)
over several steps if required.

Quantitatively - for 60% ethanol  this appears to be about 
80 degrees  which is about equal to the liquidus at 15% ethanol 
so it appears that this process can be completed in a single step.
0	By keeping the temperature of the 15% concentration ethanol above the lower curve (appears to be just above 80 degrees)  one could collect the ethanol that would be available in vapour phase  assuming you have a sealed container. As you keep heating the mixture at this temperature  you can see that the vapour collected will reach approximately 60% ethanol by drawing a horizontal line intercepting with the liquidus(lower line) and 15% ethanol fraction intersection  and extending it to meet with the upper curve. Ideally  once water can be detected in the vapour  you can stop the heating process.

You could continue increasing the percentage of ethanol concentration by lowering the temperature as the concentration of ethanol increased  but ensuring that it was always maintained above the lower curve.  However  the phase diagram shows that at about 95% ethanol concentration there would be no additional ethanol vapour being formed with this approach  which would prevent this process from creating 100% pure ethanol.
0	As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.

As a mixture with high vapour pressure has a low boiling point: a positive deviation from Raoult's law therefore we infer from the diagram that as the percentage of ethanol increases we see a lower vapour quantity and therefore lower vapour pressure. The molecules would not be able to boil off with the same ease and eventually the liquid and vapour curve would meet at 95.6% ethanol. If the mixture is re-distilled it would have the same concentration of ethanol.
0	First  you have to heat the solution above 80 degrees. After you have to condensate  the vapor in equilibrium that is enriched in the more volatile component (ethanol). This  condensed liquid should show the asked composition.
0	If we heat the solution to a temperature between 78.5 and 100  we will get vaporous ethanol and liquid water. We can then easly take out the liquid water in order to get the ethanol concentration larger.

However  as we can see in the phase diagram  at a certain ethanol concentration  a liquid "eutectic" is formed  and if we heat the solution  both water and ethanol will vaporise  which make our process uneffective at this concentration.
0	distillation.. The correct temperature ensures more alcohol goes into vapour and is condensed along with less water. Mooshiners knew the answer by  trial and error.
0	We could drop the temperature until the horizontal line corresponding to the temperature intersected the liquidus line of the graph at the point with coordinates correnponding to the desired concentration (60%). This procedure could not be used to obtain a solution with 100% composition of ethanol because at ethanols melting point  we form a solution with a very small concentration of ethanol.   
0	The ethanol-water phase diagram given here is of the minimum boiling  positive azeotropic mixture. The azeotropic mixtures on distillation of give the component near to the azeotropic point. The given phase diagram represents a 15% ethanol and 85% water system. 

The method to increase the proportion of ethanol in the system is lowering the temperature. On lowering the temperature  the system moves more towards the azeotropic boiling poing and produces more vapors of ethanol. Another way to improve the purity of ethanol is continuous distillation and on each time  we get purer form of ethanol which is near to the azeotrop. The addition of extra quantity of ethanol to the system can somehow produce ethanol level higher than that of the azeotropic poing but with purity less than that of the original concentration. The addition of a third component like benzene can favour the production of ethanol to high purity up to 99.5%.

It is the important property of azeotrop that the purity of either component cannot be raised  above the azeotropic point  therefore we cannot obtain 100% ethanol from an azeotropic mixture of ethanol-water system

0	The initial solution could be heated to a temperature as determined by the phase diagram to a specific temperature in the liquid/vapor region of the phase diagram. At equilibrium at the proper temperature  the vapor phase could be composed of 60% ethanol/40% water. Gathering the vapor and cooling back to liquid would yield a liquid solution of the desired composition.

A pure composition could not be achieved because of the eutectic point on the phase diagram. The equilibrium boiling point of progressively enriched liquids gathered from the vapor would continually decrease as the composition approached the eutectic. At the eutectic composition  the water and ethanol would both boil  making further purification by distillation impossible.
0	By vaporizing the solution and then cooling it down  the first drops of condensed solution will be richer in water than in ethanol hence the vapor will have a ethanol composition grater than 15%. Repeating this procedure many times it is posible to get a solution over 90% ethanol but not 100% because of the eutheutic. At a fraction greater than the eutheutic composition this procedure will work backwards enriching the solution with water.
0	1. Heating the solution.
2. This procedure will not yield a perfect separation of the components. Water from the surface will start to boil a little bit before of its boiling point.
0	You could lower the temperature of the solution. As the temperature of the solution lowers more of the water would freeze into ice crystals  leaving the remaining liquid solution richer in ethanol than water (i.e. w/a higher percent ethanol). If you lowered the temperature to the point where all of the water in the solution would freeze into solid crystals  the only component remaining in the liquid solution would be ethanol.
0	I could keep the solution of 15 percent ethanol at 85 degrees. Then i could remove the liquid and the remaining vapor would have the desired composicion. 
0	We have to evaporize the mixture first  then the vapor will contain more ethanol then water if we condense it we get an enriched solution  but there is a limit to this procedure wich is determined by eutactic of the mixture 
0	1) As we are cooling vaporised mixture of ethanol and water we are passing region where we are having a mixture of ethanol-rich vapor and water-reach liquid. By removing liquid we can enrich the solution.
2) We cannot get 100% ethanol  because we cannot pass eutetic point by removing liquid  and ethanol is forming Azeotrope with water.
0	-The solution can be enrich through the process of distillation: it relies on differences in the boiling points of the component liquids to be separated. The mixture to be separated is added to a Distilling Pot where it is heated to the boiling point. The Lower boiling component (ethanol)  will preferentially vaporize first. This vapor passes into a Distilling Head and then into a Condenser. Within the Condenser the vapor is cooled and it liquifies  if you can change the variation of vapor concentration  you can get the desired composition. 

-The reason because could not be to reach a completely pure composition is that the lower boiling component distills off first and can be collected. A downside of simple distillation is that the purity of the distillate is rarely 100%. This is because the distillation vapor is only enriched in the lower boiling component. Some of the higher boiling component will be present as well.

0	You must heat the solution to about 80  C and maintain the temperature to scroll the equilibrium line until the concentration of 60%.

Because there is an azeotrope
0	Solution should be vaporized and then cooled down. Cooling should be continued until there is enough water in ethanol. Distillation could help to enrich the solution because water and ethanol have different boiling points and there is a region in phase diagram where this mixture consists both of vapor and liquid.

100% ethanol can't be reached because ethanol doesn't condense without water;  a point in phase diagram where parts of the solution boil at the same temperature is on the left side of pure ethanol.
0	Heat the solution until vapour forms. At this point we have a vapour mixutre of water and ethanol.  Cooling the liquid and collecting the condensation will collect more water as it liquifies at a higher temperature  thus the remaining solution will have reduced water content.  Once the solution is about 95% ethanol this procedure won't work because the ethanol will also be distilled out.
0	adding more ethanol to make it to 60% ethanol. the amount of ethanol to be added can be calculated by ratio method.
no matter how much ethanol added  there is still some of the water in the solution that was there earlier before adding the extra ethanol. 
0	may by distillation although this would reach maximum until the eutectic point in the eutectic point would be in the highest concentration possible because after that point generates an equilibrium which is favorable to leggar a higher concentration of the eutectic.
0	If you cool a 85/15 vapor  then at the liquidus line you will have a higher percent water precipitate out into a liquid.  If you collect the vapor it will have a higher percent ethanol.  You can repeat the process and you will again have a higher percent ethanol.  Effectively you would repeatedly cool and separate the liquid and vapor  with each iteration having a higher percent ethanol vapor and higher percent water liquid.

You could not reach 100 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is below 100 percent.  At that point  when you precipitate out the liquid it will have the same percent ethanol as the vapor.  You are effectively stuck it seems.
0	One starts with a liquid of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water.  One then increases the temperature. When the temperature reaches 80 degrees C (approximately)  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve (that is  the tie line corresponding to T = 80 degrees C). The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.

Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one "goes down the lens-shaped diagram". The presence of the azeotrope in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the azeotropic point  one would need to "go up the little lens-shaped diagram"  which is not possible.  
0	You could enrich a solution of ethanol from 15% to 60% in water by heating at78.5 degrees celsius under pressure as both solutions are miscible at this precise temperature. It would not completely reach 100% ethanol because it would become saturated and the melting point would shift more as it moved at equilibrium with water vapour.
0	In order to get a solution with 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water we need to collect the vapor phase formed at approximately 85C and cool down this phase.

The process to get a richer etanol solution is basically to collect the vapor satureted with ethanol that formes during the cooling down at the two phase field and to make this same process again and again with the vapor  but nearly to 0.95 ethanol fraction we have a point where the vapor don't increase the ethanol contend anymore  thus this point don't allow us to get a higher purity phase that can be collect.
0	Raise the temperature of the mixture to appx. 80 degrees at which point it will start boiling.  Follow the 80 degree tie-line to the vapor phase to determine the composition of the vapor emitted.  It's at appx. the 60% ethanol point.  Collect and cool this vapor to get desired composition.  Because the tie-line stops at the falling vapor line  and the vapor line starts to rise at appx. 95% ethanol  that's the limiting composition of this technique.

0	One could distill it down. Increase temperature and collect vapor (e.g. by condensation). Distillation would never reach pure ethanol  since some water would be mixed into the vapor. 
0	by heating the original mixture (15 percent ethanol and 85 percent water) up to 80 degree one gets a vapor of ethanol and water plus solution of water/ethanol  by cooling down the vapor to about 50 degree  we will get a solution composed of 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water. since the melting point of the ethanol is much lower than the one for water it is impossible to get 100 percent ethanol following the procedure. 
0	Raise the temperature of the liquid solution to the liquid and vapor phase. At lower temperatures in the liquid vapor phase  ethanol will have a higher vapor fraction. We can extract the vapor and condense the vapor only to form a richer solution. 

Cannot reach a pure solution  because some water will always be vapor in the region.

0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or vice versa  remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's impossible to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.
0	heat up to 85C approximately  since that's where liquid is in equilibrium w/60% vapor. capture vapor.
you could then condense vapor and heat again to about 65C to get to eutectic composition.
once there though you can't heat and get a mixture of phases to work with. so you can't get purer than eutectic composition.


0	1. Simply use the distillation. By making a vapor from water and keeping a alcohol liquid.
2. Because even in the temperatures close to the boiling point there is a small fraction of water.
0	Because the phase diagram is dependent on concentration and not on volume  adding ethanol to the solution could eventually produce a 60% EtOH 40% water composition  although this concentration will never reach 100% EtOH as the water already present will not be eliminated simply by adding more ethanol.
0	One can increase the concentration of ethanol in the mixture by cooling the solution.A completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol would not occur because for this to happen the mixture would be a vapor
0	You have to lower the temperature until around 65C to get the right ratio. You will not able to get 100% ethanol solution  because lowest line (liquid border) does not reach 100% axis  it reachs only until euthetic point.
0	when we heat the liquid mixture of water and ethanol the liquid in the botton and the temperature increases. It will be less and less ethanol in it and the gasoline on the top will get cooler  and the percentage of ethanol increase.
after a period of time the liquid contain mostly the water while the gasoline contian about 95% of ethanol and water and ethanol reach the constant boiling point.
so we can not get the pure ethanol gasoline

0	Heat the mixture to about 80C  but less than 100C at which temperature there will be present a mixture of two phases (liquid and gas which will contain a mixture of both compounds in transition). Allow the gas to cool to about 70C  at which temperature the composition should be 60-40 liquid and any gas(es) higher than that composition will remain in the gas phase.
0	Enter response here.
increase the amount of ethanol in the mixture by adding more amount of ethanol 
0	One could increase the temperature to about 80 degrees and than collect the vapor and decrease it's temperature in a new container. Some of the water wouldn't vaporize and the composition would change. It is impossible to reach completely pure composition of 100% ethanol  because at the eutectic point (ca. 95% ethanol on the diagram) both substances vaporize in the same temperature.
0	Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C.
Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution.
0	Vaporize the given solution and bring the temperature to around 90 degrees Celsius.  Now a 60% sample of ethanol will exist in the vapor.  The liquid that will be created will be of a smaller concentration of ethanol and greater concentration of water.  The liquid can be removed and then the vapor can be condensed.  The condensed vapor can then be vaporized again  and slowly brought down to another temperature within the elliptic overlap.  A pure composition of 100% ethanol is impossible because of the jump that occurs at the right of the graph.  The purest that the sample can be is ~95% ethanol.  
0	Starting with 15% ethanol solution in the liquid phase  we can heat it into the two-phase region  which means that instead of a solution  it will be a mixture of liquid and gas.  We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.
Because it's very difficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.  In addition  the eutectic point forbid us to collect vapor with a higher concentration of ethanol using this method past a certain point.

0	"heat the liquid. It will form a liquid/gas equilibrium with a gas richer in ethanol than in water. If you take the gas by removing the liquid  and cool it  you get a liquid richer in ethanol. Repeat until you reach the good composition.

It's not possible to reach 100% because we cannot go further than the eutectic point."

0	I would use distillation  which is a process used to enrich a mix of two or more liquids with different boiling points. This process consists of heating the mix and then the compound with the lower boiling point will evaporate  separating it from the mix. Using this  you will get a vapor rich in ethanol and a liquid rich in water.

Distillation can not be used to reach a pure composition of 100% ethanol because the mix forms an azeotrope at 96% ethanol (maximum composition of ethanol you can obtain). At this point  the mix behaves like only one component with a boiling point that is lower than that of either component  so you can not separate them. In addition  you can not reach an efficiency of 100% in the process.
0	by lowering temperture
0	For that purpose one should heat the solution up to 90C getting a solution enriched to a 40% of ethanol  this process is called distillation.
To enrich the solution with more ethanol it is necessary to do another distillation  this one at 80C getting a solution with a 60% of ethanol on it. 
This process cannot be used to get pure composition of ethanol because the maximun amount of ethanol that can be reached is approximately 95%.
0	From the diagram the top line on the left hand side is not marked as water or ethanol  but I assume it must be water as ethanol has a lower boiling point. If you boiled the mixture  the water part would only just be turning to gas  but there would be more of the ethanol as gas as that would have started getting enough energy to be a gas for a longer time - so the vapour coming off would be more ethanol - somehow you could catch that somewhere else  and end up with more ethanol in that mixture.

You probably couldn't get 100% ethanol because as you got closer to the eutectic point  the mixture would boil off and the vapour would actually tend to be lower in ethanol than you wanted (or the same constant 95% or whatever it is)  and you couldn't get it any higher this way.
0	When the solution of 15 percent ethanol-85 percent water is heated (named point A) until around 77~79 degree  it will hit the boiling curve right above point A (named B)  whereby the vapor composition is 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. Draw a line which will join the boiling curve at the right hand side (point C) and the vapor will condense to the liquid curve to get 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (point D  right below point C) at around 70~72 degree Celsius.

This procedure cannot be employed to obtain pure ethanol as this require the mixture to have a zero partial pressure. 
0	Heating the Mixture to about 80C will induce bioling. At 80 the Vapour countains about 60% Ethanol 
which can be caught and separately condensed by cooling.
The procedure can not reach levels of 100% Ethanol (Even in repetition).
The best concentration to be reached is about 96% at the eutectic point. There the heating of the liquid produces directly 100% vapor composed of  the same composition of Ethanol and water  without a liquid phase.
0	I have no clue.
0	I can heat the solution water+ethanol and collect the vapor that forms at about 80 degrees. As the ethanol boils at lower T  the vapor should be richer in alcohol. Cooling this vapor should give me a solution richer in ethanol. 
I can't obtain a 100% pure ethanol  as there is an eutectic at 95%
0	We can get to 60 percent ethanol by cooling down the solution.
Because we have a minimum temperature on the curve and the maximum ethanol is 97 percent.
0	Heat solution to evaporate ethane (above 80 degrees for 15%  but well below 100 to avoid water to evaporate). Cool down (condese) vapor which will be rich in ethane.

As we evaporate ethane  its concentration lowers and temp has to be increased. As we get closer to 100 degrees  water vapor proportion increases ... not allowing 100% separation.
0	Enter response here.
Raise temp of solution to 85 degrees.  Collect vapor and condense to enrich solution in ethanol.
0	Heat to the boiling point ~80 degC. Collect the vapor component  lead it to another chamber  cool down and condense.

Boiling boint starts to increase from 5 degC
0	You can enrich a mixture of 15% ethanol and 85% water by cooling the mixture to about the temperature range between 90 degrees and a temperature slightly above the eutectic temperature.

The proceedure can't be used to produce a completely pure ethanol because at some point (or temperature) a eutectic mixture is formed having  96% ethanol and 4% water.
0	We can enrich the solution by distilling it and recover the distillate. When we boil that solution  the vapor contains both ethanol and water. Based on the phase diagram  we can have a one-step distillation to achieve an approximate of 60:40 ethanol water solution  that is  the distillate we could recover.

Further distillation steps for each distillate concentrates the ethanol solution. However  we cannot attain 100 percent ethanol if we use ethanol-water solution. Further purification processes will attain the ultimate distillate  an approximately 97% ethanol solution. The 97% ethanol solution is already an azeotrope. Further distillation for this will only acquire vapor that has the same composition with the liquid counterpart.
0	We should heat up the solution up to about 83 C. At that temperature we'll have some small percent of the liquid gone into vapor. According to the phase diagram that vapor will have about 60% ethanol at that temperature. If we take the vapor out and cool it down somewhere else we'll have the liquid solution of the required ethanol-water composition.

We can't make 100% ethanol because at the boiling start temperature we get the vapor with only ~65% ethanol. And the concentration gets down if we heat up higher.

0	may by distillation although this would reach maximum until the eutectic point in the eutectic point would be in the highest concentration possible because after that point generates an equilibrium which is favorable to leggar a higher concentration of the eutectic.

Distillation is the most appropriate means to achieve this concnetracion  for distillation is not possible to achieve 100% since thermodynamically not feasible  since then the eutectic point is not favored these compositions.
0	The desired composition can be reached by following a distillation procedure where the 15/85 mixture is heated to a temperature that will support two phases simultaneously - liquid water together with a vapor that is a water-ethanol mix with a higher concentration of ethanol than the original 15/85 mixture.  The distillation temperature needs to be below the bottom boundary of the vapor phase and above the upper boundary of the liquid phase; referring to the phase diagram the horizontal line representing the appropriate temperature should intercept the vapor line where that line intercepts the vertical line for a 40/60 water/ethanol mix - i.e.  roughly 82 degrees C.  If the vapor mix is then drawn off and cooled to a point where it enters the liquid phase of the diagram  a condensate with the desired 40/60 mix should result.

To further increase the proportion of ethanol  it is necessary to move further to the right on the phase diagram  which (due to the downward slope of the vapor line) means that the distillation temperature must be reduced.  However  from the diagram the lowest usable temperature will only produce an ethanol concentration of about 95% - reducing the temperature further will keep the mixture entirely within the liquid phase  rendering distillation impossible.


0	Before we start  we need to identify the boiling points of the two components:

Water: 100C
Ethanol: 78.5C

As we can see in the diagram  the initial solution exists as liquid at a temperature below the boiling point of ethanol  and the final solution that we need to obtain exists at a temperature ~70C.
 
So in order to enrich the initial solution  we could increase the temperature of the initial solution to approximately 80C  then extract the vapor that we produced because at that temperature the final solution exists in two phases (liquid + vapor) so we're able to begin the decrease of the temperature of the vapor we obtained before at a final temperature below at 78C  in order to obtain the solution  in the liquid state  that we need (60% ethanol/ 40% water).

0	1. First heat the mixture at 80 deg C and collect the vapor. Now condensate the vapor till all become liquid. The resultant mixture composition will be approximately 60% of ethanol  40% of water. 

2. The repeated process will result in a mixture closer to azeotropic ratio (95% Ethanol: 5% Water). The composition can not be altered further by distillation process.  
0	Let's assume first the solution is at room temperature.
Heat up solution to 90 degrees. The solution starts to evaporate but more water than ethanol evaporates. Cool down the solution. The ethanol concentration has increased.
Repeat the heat up - cool down cycle until ethanol concentration reaches 60 percent.
Ethanol concentration cannot reach 100% because when the solution evaporates both water and ethanol evaporates. It is not possible to evaporate water only.

0	This binary mixture boils at 78.2 degree centigrade which a lower temperature of boiling of either of the constituents.Ethanol Water makes a constant boiling mixture.15% to 60 % purity can be obtained in multiple stages.This type of mixture is called Azeotropic mixture & process is called Azeotropic Distillation.We could obtained maximum purity in this case up to 95.6 %. 
0	- increase temperature to vaporize and separate water and the ethanol - distillation process.
- this procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol because both water and ethanol will then evaporate upon reaching a high temp required before the ethanol reaches the 100% composition
0	Starting with a solution of 15%EtOH/85%H20 and raising the temperature ~80oC will put the liquid in equilibrium with a vapor phase consisting of ~60%EtOH/40%H20.   This vapor could be cooled and the condensate collected to produce a liquid which is enriched in EtOH.    

Repeated distillation of the condensate will not lead to enrichment in the EtOH concentration of the Vapor to anything greater than 95% percent.  At this eutectic point  95% EtOH/5%H20 composition of liquid is in equilibrium with the same composition in the vapor.   Further enrichment of EtOH will not be possible in this two phase system. 
0	When the solution is heated up to 80 degrees of celsius the liquid starts to boil and the vapors that created have an  equilibrium composition with enriched ethanol if we cool them down we can get a larger percentage of ethanol. We can only go up to 96 % of ethanol in the solution  because in this point we have the eutectic  We have ethanol  water and vapors nad its the point of the lowest temperature that there are vapors.
0	A water-ethanol solution with 15% ethanol at ~80 degrees C (or slightly more) will have liquid water and vaporous ethanol  since 90 degrees is past the boiling point of water  100 degrees C  and not past the boiling point of ethanol  78.5 degrees C. You can take out the liquid water easily. This could make the solution 60% ethanol. However  it couldn't make it 100% ethanol because the phase diagram shows that once the solution goes past a certain concentration of ethanol  water won't condense anymore. If you lower the temperature to let the water condense  then the ethanol will also condense. Therefore  the process can only enrich the solution to a point  and can't completely remove the water.
0	One could enrich the solution from 15% ethanol to 60% ethanol by cooling the mixture from the temperature where the liquidis matches the 15% composition to a temperature where the 60% composition meets the temperature of the liquidis at that composition and then distilling the liquid off at that temperature.

One couldn't reach 100% composition of ethanol because between 90% and 100% there is a eutectic point where at that temperature the liquid sublimates directly to a vapor and no liquid could be distilled from that point.


0	Heat 15% solution to approx 80C. Boiling occurs  with the vapor mixture produced (per my eyes) having a  composition that is ~60% ethanol/40% water.   Withdraw newly formed vapor and condense.

If this process is repeated  (e.g. starting with 60/40 liquid)  it will boil at somewhat lower temp  and produce higher EtOH fraction.  But process will end at intersection of two phase groups (approx 96% EtOH.)  Any vapor produced from boiling at this point will have same concentration as liquid- so no further separation is possible.
0	The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. This resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.

From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%.

0	Cooling the solution would move the composition along the liquidus to a solution more enriched in ethanol. This procedure will not produce a composition of 100% ethanol as a liquid-vapor eutectic is reached at the minimum temperature on the liquidus  at around 95% ethanol. 
0	You can heat the solution until it starts to boil. The phase diagram tells you that the first vapor will be highly concentrated in ethanol  while the remaining liquid will be highly concentrated in water (the intersection of the tie line and the liquidus gives you the concentration of the vapor while the intersection with the solidus gives you the concentration of the liquid). This vapor can be collected in another flask and will be 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water if you do not let the temperature get to high. 
However  you cannot get completely pure ethanol because the vapor will have the concentration of the intersection between the tie line and the liquidus which has a maximum at roughly 96 percent (azeotropic point) (actually  the maximum is the intersection of the liquidus and the tie line that intersects the solidus at the initial concentration of the solution; however  if you take your distillate and distill it again  the new maximum concentration will be higher and aproach the azeotropic concentration with further distillation cycles). 
0	Boil the mixture and then cool the vapor mixture. 

0	Heat the 15 percent ethanol solution until it reached the boiling point of approx 80C. The vapors have a composition of approx 60 percent ethanol (the intersection of the horizontal 80C line with the vapor curve). By collecting and condensing those vapors one obtains a solution of 60 percent ethanol.

Successive boil/condense cycles will "converge" to the concentration of the eutectic point at approx 96 percent ethanol.
0	
By keeping the temperature of the 15% concentration ethanol above the lower curve (appears to be just above 80 degrees)  one could collect the ethanol that would be available in vapour phase  assuming you have a sealed container. As you keep heating the mixture at this temperature  you can see that the vapour collected will reach approximately 60% ethanol by drawing a horizontal line intercepting with the liquidus(lower line) and 15% ethanol fraction intersection  and extending it to meet with the upper curve. Ideally  once water can be detected in the vapour  you can stop the heating process.

You could continue increasing the percentage of ethanol concentration by lowering the temperature as the concentration of ethanol increased  but ensuring that it was always maintained above the lower curve.  However  the phase diagram shows that at about 95% ethanol concentration there would be no additional ethanol vapour being formed with this approach  which would prevent this process from creating 100% pure ethanol.
0	In a closed container heat up the 15%-ethanol solution enough so that we move up from the region of liquid to the region of liquid + vapor. The composition of the vapor is given by moving to the right along a tie-line; it will be richer in ethanol. Remove the now ethanol-poor liquid and cool the vapor to get a liquid with a higher percentage of ethanol. It so happens that there is a tie-line connecting a little less than 15% to 60%  so we could heat to a minimum temperature and in one step get a very small amount of 60% solution. But in general we can't expect to do this. We would heat to a higher temperature and obtain sub-60% ethanol liquid and then repeat the procedure. This procedure "lives"  so to speak  in the liquid + vapor lens that is to the left of the liquidus minimum point at 95% ethanol. So we can never get 100% ethanol.

Slowly  subtly heat the liquor.
Steamy booze is really great
But sup upon the condensate.
Still  200 proof is beyond hope 
Alas for cursed azeotrope!
No further reward for constant toiling

0	we must be carefully
0	You'd distill the 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water at about 80 degrees Celsius (as per the tie line) to bring it to 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. The ethanol has a lower boiling point than water  so it's going vaporize more than the water and thus you'd end up with a greater ethanol to water ratio in the distillate. You couldn't get 100% ethanol from this method since the eutectic point is at about 95%  the reason being that a 95 percent ethanol - 5 percent water mixture has a lower boiling point than either pure ethanol or pure water.
0	This is a wrong answer.
0	In order to enrich the solution  you would have to remove pluto from orbit.
0	A solution of 15% ethanol and 85% water can be enriched up to 60% ethanol and 40% water by distillation of the ethanol out of the ethanol-water mixture. Because water boils at 100C and ethanol at 78C  at the lower boiling point the ethanol will vaporize and can be condensed by cooling. But the mixture also has a lower boiling point than water so the ethanol will not be pure. This can be further enriched by repeating the distillation process. 
The point where the mixture becomes an azeotrope  which means that the 2 components will boil at the same temperature and so cannot be separated further  is indicated by the low point where the 2 curves meet on the graph at about 95% ethanol and 5% water.

0	To enrich a solution we need to add ethanol. Because of water not pure material we never get 100% ethanol.
0	I see various possibilities:
1. Add  liquid ethanol to the inicial solution at low temperature (<70C: all liquid). 100% ethanol isnt possible because this method doesnt remove the water.

2. Cool the hot inicial vapor solution (>100C) down; it forms liquid water with elevated fraction of ethanol into the vapor. Filter the liquid water out. The vapor composition moves to the right in the diagram. 
With the appropriate temperature its is possible to reach at 95% ethanol in the vapor (at the eutectic point).
0	Increasin the temperature  the ethanol would go to the vapor phase.
0	None
0	Heat to the boiling point ~80 degC. Collect the vapor component  lead it to another chamber  cool down and condense.

At ethanol fractions above 95%  the alcohol fraction will instead be reduced by the distillation procedure.
0	We're starting with a 15% Ethanol solution  which assumes a liquid phase. Change the temperature (higher) toward the water liquid / vapor equilibrium. When this equilibrium point is reached the water component starts to become a vapor and water content is reduced. To continue reducing the water content it is now necessary to reduce temperature slowly. As the temperature is reduced  more water content will be vaporized and the goal of a 60% Ethanol solution will be reached.

When the solution becomes sufficiently enriched there is insufficient water content to continue vaporizing the water and the vaporization of water stops. Chilling further would not enrich the solution  it would just turn more fulling into the liquid phase.
0	1/ Enrich solution to 60/40
Heat liquid to 80 C max. The vapor generated will be richer in Ethanol than liquid.
At half of vaporization cold the vapor (richer in ethanol than initial liquid). The rest of liquid has less ethanol

Reproduce the process each time with a liquid with higher percentage of ethanol

2/ this process will be limit due to the eutectic point that give a limit of ethanol concentration.
0	Heat to 8O C and then cool quickly. Repeat this procedure to increase the ethanol content.
0	First we have to heat the system and gather the vapor generated -which will have more ethanol than water-.
Then we have to condense that vapor and heat it again and gather "the second vapor" to condense it and heat it again -far more ethanol than water-.
That way we get a solution richer in ethanol.
We can not get 100 percent ethanol  because at one point "the nth vapor" gathered will have the same composition as the solution from where it came  that is called an azeotrope. Meaning that the ethanol you want to purify boils at a slightly higher temperature than the azeotrope. 
0	When the ethanol-water solution is heated to a temperature in the liquid-vapor region the solution splits along a tie line into an ethanol rich vapor  and a water rich liquid. If the solution is heated to a temperature that has a tie line with a vapor composition of 60% ethanol  then 60% ethanol can be produced.This procedure would not work for pure ethanol because at this pressure the ethanol has no way of getting past the eutectic point.

0	We could increase the concentration of ethanol and increase the temperature so that the liquid evaporates out and the required solution is reached.
0	Enter response here. This is unique  I promise!
0	A sample of 15% ethanol is placed in a distillation apparatus and heated at about 78 - 80 degree centigrade. Receive the pure ethanol in the distillate receiving flask. Finally  prepare 60% ethanol from the distillate alcohol.  
0	
this procedure could not be used to reach 100% pure alco.  because there will be always a part of water which we cant separate while we are behind azeotropic point. behind this point water and ethanol are unseparable from each other thanks to the same boiling point.
0	Distill at 72C: Using the Lever Rule  Vertical line at 60% EtOH intersects VaporUS line at ~81C  but intersects the LiquidUS line at 72C  hence fractional distillation at 72C (with a vapor collector/condenser) should enrich liquid phase to 60% EtOH. 

An azeotrope at ~95% ethanol  with steep slope at 78.5C  indicates that water plus EtOH will co-exist as liquid plus vapor at >95% EtOH  complicating achieving pure 100% EtOH. The fractional composition of the water will be under 5%  but removing this residual is complicated by the steep slope above the azeotropic temperature.
0	modifiin temperture
0	We have to cool the solution down. At about 70 degrees the solution is of approximately desired composition  as the liquidus line at this temperature indicates. However  further cooling will only lead to freezing of both components (at the eutectic).
0	ethanol vaporizes at 78.5C  so you can heat heat it up to this temperature and vaporize it completely and capture the ethanol (vapor) in a separate pot and cool it down and you have a pure composition of 100% ethanol.
I assume that the system above which the phase diagram refers to is a closed system where no matter can escape. I think you can increase the volume of ethanol here from 15% to 60% by heating it up to about 71C because increasing temperature is proportional to larger volume. But you have to keep it at the new temperature then because otherwise the volume starts shrinking.
It is impossible to reach 100% ethanol in the closed system because the ethanol requires therefore a temperature of 98C  and is no longer liquid  so you would have 2 phases: liquid water and ethanol vapor above it.
0	It is affected by the relative quantities of ethanol and water  and also by the temperature. 
This means that as the temperature varies  the volume of the ethanol portion of the mixture changes faster than that of the water portion.
0	To enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water up to 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water  one could use the difference of vapour pressure of the two substances. A method of doing so is by elevating the temperature up to the point in which almost all ethanol is vaporized. Then  the ethanol gas should be separeted from the mixture  causing the temperature to drop  and  due to its vapour pressure  more ethanol to vaporize. The ethanol should be once more separeted from the mixture. This procedure could be followed until the desired point (60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water) is reached.
Unfortunatelly  this procedure can't be followed to reach 100 percent ethanol composition because the diagram shows an azeotropic point  close to a 95 percent ethanol - 5 percent water composition. When this point is reached  just increasing the temperature won't change the composition because both substances boil equally. Also  at that point  the composition of the vapour is the same as the liquid
0	As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapors. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapor and alcohol vapor. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapor content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapors to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.

As a mixture with high vapor pressure has a low boiling point: a positive deviation from Raoult's law therefore we infer from the diagram that as the percentage of ethanol increases we see a lower vapor quantity and therefore lower vapor pressure. The molecules would not be able to boil off with the same ease and eventually the liquid and vapor curve would meet at 95.6% ethanol. If the mixture is re-distilled it would have the same concentration of ethanol.

0	Heat up the solution of 15% Ethanol - 85% water to beyond 100degrees to get a vapor phase of the 2 components. Then cool down the system to 75 degrees. At this temperature  a solution phase with 60% ethanol - 40% water will be present and this would be in equilibrium with the vapor phase that now contains less % ethanol. 

This procedure cannot be used to get 100% Ethanol because the boiling point of water is higher than Ethanol  or in other words  water will condense at a higher temperature (before ethanol) during the cooling process.
0	The solution of 15% ethanol-85% water is heated to 90 degree celsius. It changes into vapour. As it cools  it condenses back into liquid. The liquid formed is taken out. Then  it changes to vapour again before condensing back into liquid. The process is continued until it reaches a composition of 60% ethanol-40% water.

It will reach eutectic instead of pure composition of 100% ethanol. At eutectic composition  there is no change in composition since there is no degree of freedom according to phase rule.
0	Enter response here A solution of 85 % water and 15 % ethanol is in equilibrium with vapor with about 60% ethanol and 40 % water (draw the tie line across). By cooling this vapor to liquid  we can enrich the 85/15 solution to 40/60 (water:ethanol).

This procedure cannot be used to get 100 % ethanol  because water and ethanol form an azeotropic mixture and it is impossible to produce a distillate richer in ethanol than the azeotrope by stepwise distillation. The same steps repeat after the azeotrope.
0	Distillation.  Ethanol has a lower vaporization temperature than water  so you slowly heat the liquid up.  The vapors will be a higher concentration of ethanol than water.  You use a condenser to collect the vapors and turn them back into a liquid.  This is how rum  whiskey  vodka and other hard liquors are made.  You can't go to 100% in one step  because the maximum ethanol content of the vapor is determined by the right boundary of the upper curve  which doesn't go to 100% for any temperature that has a liquid-vapor phase at 15% ethanol.
0	An enriched solution could be obtained by vaporization of the solution. According to the phase diagram  a vapor with a higher fraction of ethanol would be obtained. Adjusting the time and the amount of vapour created (of which the fraction of ethanol is decreasing more and more) a gas of the composition need could be obtained. When this gas is cooled down completely  you would have the composition neded.

The horizontal line cutting the 15 % vertical line at the point when the latter goes through the liquidus tells you the composition of the vapor: It's the composition where the horizontal goes through the vaporidus (or whatever it might be called :)). As you can see  this does not allow for concentration of 100 %. Neither does any liquid with lower concentration in ethanol that might by obtained during vaporizing the liquid.
0	Heat to a temperature of ~80 degC  this will move us into a phase with all of the ethanol in gaseous form and only a fraction of water in gaseous form. Collect the vapor component  lead it to another chamber  cool down and condense.

The boiling point is lowest for a ~95% solution of ethanol  so it will spontaneously absorb water in order to regain this energy.
0	By increasing the temperature of a liquid solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water  we can come up with a vapor that contains more ethanol than water. At a certain temperature  we will obtain a vapor that contains 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water. With the given composition  however  we cannot obtain 100 percent ethanol. No matter what temperature  there will be at least some water contained in a single phase  because we will meet the eutectic before reaching that composition.
0	This can be achieved using distillation:

The solution must be heated until ethanol starts vaporizing  meanwhile the water will remain liquid as it has a higher boiling point than ethanol. Then the liquid phase of the solution  which is mostly water  must be drain . Finally vapor phase of the solution must be cooled until it condenses  the remaining solution will have a higher content of ethanol.
0	By evaporating the solution at temperatures about 80oC ethanol vaporized and leaves behind a solution rich in water. At about 80oC the vapor is in equilibrium with a liquid solution of 60% ethanol and 40% water. By then cooling the vapor at less than about 70oC both water and ethanol are condensed (water first). 

Since both water and ethanol are present in the vapor first water is condensed  so the solution always contain some amount of water.  
0	You can use process of distillation. 
You should slowly heat the liquid solution. Once it reaches eutectic line  vapor containing water 5% and ethanol 95% will start to form. Once all ethanol fraction is vaporized  pure water will start to vaporize too. This water vapour will lover the fraction of ethanol so you should not exceed temperature of 80C - if you want to achieve 60% ethanol.
Take the vapor away  cool id down and you have the enriched solution.

You can't reach more ethanol in the vapor than the eutectic at 95% if your original fraction was less. Because when warming up above the eutectic point  you'll move along the "vaporus" line towards the original fraction.
0	If we begin with a solution of 15% ethanol/85% water in the liquid phase and bring it to a boil  we will have a gas/liquid mixture where the liquid is relatively rich in water and the vapor is relatively rich in ethanol. We should boil this to the temperature where the tie line intersects the vaporus (?) line at 60% ethanol  and our gas will be 60% ethanol and 40% water. If we want it as a liquid  we can recondense it after physically separating it from the liquid.

We cannot reach a pure composition of 100% ethanol because the liquidus and vaporus lines are always below 100% ethanol except where we begin with 100% ethanol  so the vapor and the liquid will always have a non-zero percentage of water in them.


0	A water-ethanol solution with 15% ethanol at ~80 degrees Celsius (or slightly more) will have liquid water and vaporous ethanol  since 90 degrees is past the boiling point of water  100 degrees Celsius  and not past the boiling point of ethanol  78.5 degrees Celsius. You can take out the liquid water easily. This could make the solution 60% ethanol. However  it couldn't make it 100% ethanol because the phase diagram shows that once the solution goes past a certain concentration of ethanol  water won't condense anymore. If you lower the temperature  to let the water condense  then the ethanol will also condense. Therefore  the process can only enrich the solution to a point (the eutectic point)  and can't completely remove the water.
0	You need to heat up the solution to 80C  temperature in which the solution starts to boil. At that temperature  the vapor has a higher concentration of ethanol than the liquid (approximately a composition of 60% of ethanol)  so you have to extract the vapor and condense it  and you will have a solution of 60% ethanol-40% water.

Althought we can repite this procedure (heat up the new solution to the boiling temperature  extract the vapor  condense it and repite all over again)  it could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 % of ethanol  because when you reach the eutectic composition (96% ethanol-4% water)  the vapor has the same concentration than the solution  so the vaporization happens without vary the concentration and that's why you can't have a solution with a higher concentration of ethanol by this method.
0	blablabla
0	heat the liquid. It will form a liquid/gas equilibrium with a gas richer in ethanol than in water. If you cool down the gas after separating it from the liquid phase  you get a liquid with a bigger ethanol proportion.

By reapeating this procedure  you can increase the ethanol proportion in the liquid comming from the gas. But if the liquid has more than ~95% ethanol (at the eutectic point) you get a gas richer in water than the initial liquid. So the distillation can only go up to this eutectic point. (and if you have a liquid at the eutectic composition  the gas will have the same composition.
0	At the first composition: the vapor-liquid boundary is at a temperature of ~98%. If the temperature is lowered from 98% to ~84%  liquid will condense and the composition  of the remaining liquid/vapor will move down the along the liquid-vapor boundary to the 60ethanol:40water composition.
0	Lower the temperature to the point below the solidus line at composition 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water. 
because there temperature where there is 100precent ethanol is also the temperature where there is 70 percent ethanol and 30percent water with a mixture of vapour and some liquid. and its also the temperature where there is 30percent ethanol and 70 water of liquid
0	Enter response here.
To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.
Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol.

 
0	We will add 45% Ethanol  of the total volume with increasing the temperature within 70C and 95.
We can't use 
to reach a completly pure composition of ethanol because we will reach 100C knowing that ethanol has very low melting point as all organic compounds will be evaporated also and we will have only one phase which is vapor and no liquid.
0	Heat solution to above the boiling point of ethanol and collect the evaporated ethanol in a flask after cooling it down with a condenser. At around 82 degrees Celsius  the sixty percent solution of ethanol will be obtained. Water and ethanol forms an azeotropic solution.  
0	A solution of 15% ethanol starts out on the lower left of the diagram  but if it is heated to about 83 degrees or so  it will move up into the region between the two curves. Thus it will split into a liquid phase  with composition more like 12% ethanol (the point to the left of (15%  83 degrees))  and a vapor phrase  with composition more like 60% ethanol (the point to the right of (15%  83 degrees)). The liquid phase can be removed  and the vapor phase condensed  to form a liquid phase of composition 60% ethanol.

The highest composition ethanol that could be reached by one step of this procedure can be found by taking the starting composition  tracing up to the top of the liquid phase  tracing right to the bottom of the vapor phase  and then tracing down again. However  these sequence converges on the kind-of-eutectic-point at about 95.5% ethanol. If that azeotrope were heated  it would not split into a liquid and a vapor phase. It would just vaporize.
0	o
0	Distillation.
We could just heat the liquid 15% mixture to above 80 % to have a liquid-vapor mixture. The vapor would have a higher composition in ethanol than the liquid. This vapor could be condensed appart from the liquid to have a more concentrate liquid.
Due to the shape of the curve  it is difficult to have a significant amount of vapor of 60% directly from 15%. If we go to the liquidus curve (bubble point) and see the concentration of the vapor it would be around 60% but the production would be almost 0. A solution to this would be generate a higher amount of less concentrated vapor (let's say 40% with T=90 C aprox)  condense it and repeat the process taking advantage of how the curvature of the liquidus changes.

It is not possible to reach a 100% of purity because of the point around 96% in which the liquid and vapor have the same composition. If we reach that point by the previous distillation method  in the next step  the vapor and the liquid would have exactly the same composition  so it is impossible to enrich any of the phases. This point is called an azeotrope.
0	You have to lower the temperature until around 65C to get the right ratio. You will not able to get 100% ethanol solution  because lowest line (liquid border) doesnt reach 100% axis  it reachs only until euthetic point.

0	we can boil the solution up to 90 C and separate vapour from liquid. At this temperature we have both phases  liquid  which is rich in water  and vapour  which is "rich" in ethanol.
If we condensate this vapour we obtain a liquid with an approximately 40% of ethanol.
if we repeat this we can increse the ethanol % up to 95%  in where it's not possible to separate liquid from vapour. 
0	 At the composition where the upper curve showing vapour phase meets the lower curve  liquid and vapour phases will have same composition. At this point at constant temperature the mixture will distil over completely without any change in its composition or as an Azeotropic mixture till  about 96% by mass of ethanol and water ). Ethanol- water forms a MInimum Boiling Azeotrope and the mixture will have maximum vapour pressure. Ethanol starts distilling out first   but once an azeotrope is formed between ethanol and water  it is not possible to separate them by distillation.  The azeotropic mixture behaves like a single substance. 
So  continuous distillation from 15% ethanol -85% water composition till the mixture attains  azeotropic composition  will ensure enrichment of ethanol in the sample. Hence 60-40 mixture distillation pose no problem. But separation of  the azeotrope need sophisticated techniques employing drying  adsorption etc
0	If you keep the temperature at Ethanol's BP  then the only substance in vapor phase will be the ethanol.   Once you reach the eutectic point  then there will still be too much water vapor in the vapor sample to remove anymore water.  
0	To do this  it is necessary to heat the solution  which contains 15% ethanol and 85% water  from 79 C to 70 5 C.

Azeotrope of water and ethanol contains 96% of ethanol and boils at 78 C. This explains the industrial concentration of ethyl alcohol: this is an azeotrope and it can not be divided into fractions by simple distillation.
0	One starts with a liquid of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water.  One then increases the temperature. When the temperature reaches 80C (approximately)  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve (that is  the tie line corresponding to T = 80C). The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.

Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one "goes down the lens-shaped diagram". The presence of the azeotrope in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the azeotropic point  one would need to "go up the little lens-shaped diagram"  which is not possible.  
0	Let's assume first the solution is at room temperature.
Increase temperature until solution reaches equilibrium liquid and vapour state. Increase the temperature more and the solution starts to evaporate. As solution contains more water than ethanol a bigger proportion of water evaporates hence the ethanol percentage increases.
Continue the process increasing slowly the temperature and keeping the solution in liquid and vapour equilibrium until ethanol reaches 50 percent.
0	One could distill it down. Decrease temperature and collect ice (e.g. by condensation). Distillation would always reach pure ethanol  since some water would not be mixed into the vapor. 
0	Condensing a vapor made from the initial solution could produce rich ethanol.
The procedure could not be used to reach pure 100% ethanol because some water would evaporate along with it because of their BP difference.

0	he liquid curve and the vapour curve meet at that point. The vapour produced will have that same composition of 95.6% ethanol. If you condense it again  it will still have that same composition.

You have hit a barrier. It is impossible to get pure ethanol by distiling any mixture of ethanol and water containing less than 95.6% of ethanoll.

This particular mixture of ethanol and water boils as if it were a pure liquid. It has a constant boiling point  and the vapour composition is exactly the same as the liquid.

It is known as a constant boiling mixture or an azeotropic mixture or an azeotrope.

The implications of this for fractional distillation of dilute solutions of ethanol are obvious. The liquid collected by condensing the vapour from the top of the fractionating column can't be pure ethanol. The best you can produce by simple fractional distillation is 95.6% ethanol.
0	Heat the solution with reflux condenser (distillation) at 80 .
This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because in eutectic azeotrope form  which has lower boiling point then pure ethanol
0	Heat the 15% ethanol to 80 degrees  discard the liquid  and condense the remaining vapor  which will contain 60% ethanol.

The separation between the vapor and liquid equilibrium lines vanishes at an ethanol concentration of 95%.
0	Because the ethanol mix up with the water and there arent big diferencie between each other 
0	One should keep the mixture a temperature at which liquid and vapore is formed. By beeing at approx. 95C a very water rich solution will forme. By extracting this waterrich solution one will slowly rise the ethanol content.

For this purpose one have to go to 78 5C to be able to extract a ethanol rich solution  but if one is coming from the left site of the phase diagramm one will not be able to cross the minimum of the liquid line and therefore will never be able to reach the right vapor-liquid area
0	We can make rectification (distillation with rectification glass tube) of ethanol because it has less T of vaporization. In result of rectification we can obtain solution of 95.6% ethanol and 4% of water. Becaus this solution like one liquid  not like mixture. And we can observ it in diagram. Boiling point of this solution is 70 degrees. And becaus of fact that EtOH and water can make such solution it is impossible rech 100 EtOH by vaporisation.
0	by distillation  and we can not reach 100% because there is a temperature azeotrope
0	On boiling  the liquid gets poor in ethanol  but I don't think that adding more of it to compensate is allowed in this problem. If we heat the mixture to 90C  we will get a vapor phase (36% of the total) with 40% ethanol. That would allow a greater efficiency in the process  but we have got to go 80C if we want 60% ethanol vapors here.So  if we separate the vapor phase  and drive it to 80C  we will get in the new system a vapor phase (50% of the total) with 60% ethanol. Overall  we got 17% of the original mixture as 60% ethanol in this two-step distillation without adding ethanol.
0	When the ethanol-water solution is heated to a temperature in the liquid-vapor region the solution splits along a tie line into an ethanol rich vapor  and a water rich liquid. If the solution is heated to a temperature that has a tie line with a vapor composition of 60% ethanol  then 60% ethanol can be produced.
0	It can be done by partial heating at constant pressure and partially increasing pressure at constant temperature from 15/85 ethanol/water mixture till 60/40 composition is reached.
Because the boiling point of mixture is lower than the individual components   100 percent ethanol cannot be obtained.
0	According to the phase diagram  water and ethanol are miscible liquids. If the solution is currently at room temperature  heating it would cause the apparition of two different phases: a liquid phase and a vapor phase  both with water molar fraction higher as temperature increases  but different initial composition.

As temperature increases  the relative percentage of the liquid phase decreases and the relative percentage of the vapor phase increases.

An imaginary isotherm (of certain temperature) would cut the phase diagram equilibrium lines: these cut-points represent the composition of each phase (liquid and vapor) coexisting at that temperature.

After heating the initial solution obtaining two different phases (liquid and vapor)  the vapor phase which is richer in ethanol is then separated  cooled down and condensated to form a new solution (60% ethanol 40 % water).

The minimum boiling temperature for an ethanol-water solution is the temperature at which both "liquid+vapor" equilibrium fields converge; this temperature can only be reached by a solution with certain ethanol-water composition  which is the maximum ethanol-enriched vapor phase possible to obtain from the initial 85% water-15% ethanol solution.
0	Start with a liquid solution of 15% ethanol.  Since at most concentrations the boiling point of water is greater than that of ethanol  heat the solution (to about 70 C) and the ethanol will boil off while the water remains liquid.  Capture the vapor  which will contain more ethanol than water.  The vapor can then be re-condensed into liquid (be reducing the temperature)  and the process repeated.

This procedure cannot be used to reach 100% pure ethanol because at high concentrations of ethanol there is little difference in boiling point between water and ethanol.
0	When we have a solution of 15 percent ethanol to enrich at 60 percent of ethanol is needed make distillation by heating the solution between 80 and 90 degrees C for a some time.  This procedure could not be used to reach at 100 percent ethanol because when as the solution is purified have the phase graph change and the boiling point of the solution becomes lesser.
0	One could change the composition from 15% ethanol - 80% water to 60% ethanol - 40% water by lowering the temperature. These two evaporate at different temperatures  water at 100 Celsius and  ethanol at 78.5 Celsius (according to the diagram)  so to be able to reach a 100% pure ethanol would be needed water to evaporate at a lower temperature that ethanol. We have an eutectic point at 95% ethanol.
0	vaporizing the solution of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent water at 80 degrees the temperature will remain constant until all is vapor  at that moment the solution will be something around 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water according to the diagram.
This procedure can't be used to reach 100 percent ethanol because at that point is already vapor  so changing to liquid it would only make the solution goes back to the previous state.
0	Add more ethanol
0	If we were to heat the solution up to 80 degrees C  we could then add ethanol to the solution.  When ethanol concentration hits about 60%  the entire solution will begin to boil.  It is at this point when we will know we have the correct concentration  and may allow it to cool.
We cannot use this procedure to hit 100% ethanol  however  because of the eutectic at about 95%.  We can slowly lessen the temperature and add more ethanol  but once we get to the eutectic  the entire solution either exists as vapor  or as a liquid as both parts.

0	We have to obtain a vapour at 15% percent ethanol increasing temperature. This vapour condense  increasing the percent of ethanol in the liquid. This is a destillation. This liquid  is destillated again  (first increasing temperature to obtain the vapour and second decreasing and obtaining enriched liquid) .We do that until obtain the percentage we search. Due to etahnol and water form an azeotrope  its not possible with this procedure to obtain 100% ethanol
0	Heat the composition until it is in the region where it is a mixture of vapor and liquid  here by adding more ethanol vapor we will reduce the temperature until it reached the point where the vapour will become equal volume to the liquid. here theaddition will not add the composition of ethanol in the solution.
0	We follow the regular distillation procedure heating the mixture to increase the percent of water and decrease the percent of ethanol in the liquid phase while the opposite happens in the vapor. We continue until we reach 60% in the vapor what means around 80C in the thermometer place in the vapor. We could continue enrichment until we get the eutectic point. There there is difference between the liquid and vapor composition so i does not matter how long we keep our distillation going  we cannot go farther the 95% of eutectic point.

I believe one could set up a distillation apparatus and let it go until the ethanol in the solution is completely separated from the water. Then you could mix a new solution that was 60% ethanol and 40% water.

1-Heat to T within Liq-Vapor phase to increase Ethanol concentration in vapor phase.
2-Pour off liquid.
3- Condense vapor and repeat as necessary.
Eutectic at approx 0.9 fraction composition. Above 0.9 fraction Ethonal liq concentration > Vapor phase ethanol concentration
0	You must heat the solution to about 80  C and maintain the temperature to scroll the equilibrium line until the concentration of 60%.
0	increase temperature because they have a point of equilibrium at 78.5 or 100
0	Heat up 15% solution to 90 degrees C and delete all liquid. You will get vapor with 40% ethanol fraction. Then cool this vapor to 80 degrees C and delete all condensed liquid again. The resulting vapor will consist 60 % of ethanol and 40 % of water. Then condense it and get a liquid solution with 60 % of ethanol and 40 % of water.
This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because of eutectic point. In this point you have 97 % of ethanol. If you will heat up this 97% ethanol solution all solution will vaporize without L+V phase. You couldn't divide this solution by condensing and vaporizing. Every time you will get the same 97% ethanol fraction.
0	The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. This resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.

From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%. Additionally  at a concentration of ~95% ethanol  the phase diagram shows an eutectic  meaning both components transition to vapor at the same temperature point. Hence  no further gains in concentration are possible beyond ~95%.

0	To enrich a solution to a composition of 60% ethanol-40% water  one should heat up solution only to about bellow boiling point of ethanol  collect the vapor and then cool it down. The water and ethanol start vaporizing at temperature around 65 degrees C  so majority of ethanol will vaporize and only a small portion of water will vaporize with it.
The procedure can not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol  because water and ethanol start vaporizing at very close temperatures  bellow the boiling point of ethanol  so the ethanol vapor will always contain a small percent of water.
0	15-85 is above ethanol's boiling point.  Lowering temperature would condense more ethanol  until 60-40 is reached.
Eutectic composition is roughly at 95% ethanol.


0	Heat the 15% ethanol to solution to its boiling point  that looks to be approximately 79 C (from graph)  and then immediately condense the vapor  which will have a composition of a little over 60% ethanol  the remainder being water.  Continuing this process will result in an enrichment of water in the liquid solution and a consequent increasing of the boiling point. The collected vapor will therefore decrease in ethanol content. When the vapor is the same % of ethanol below 60% as the initial vapor composition was above  stop collecting the condensate.

To make the process continuous  a solution of 60% ethanol water could be added to the boiling solution at the same rate as condensate is collected. This would maintain the solution composition  the original  boiling point  and therefore the same ethanol vapor composition. But if the goal is to produce a 60% ethanol solution  this would be obviously be rather a waste of time  as a 60% solution one would have to be available.

In reality  a fractional distillation would be preferable so that 96% ethanol could be obtained  and then diluted down accordingly with water to produce the desired solution.
0	by fractional destillation; vaporizing the 15%mixture will enrich the vapor in ethanol above 15%  by subsequent cooling of this vapor we will get ethanol at higher content by repeating this several times we get more than 60% ethanol
We cannot reach pure ethanol because ethanol is a azeotrope at about 90% with same composition in liquid as vaporphase so we cannot enrich it above that
0	On boiling  the liquid gets poor in ethanol  but I don't think that adding more of it to compensate is allowed in this problem. If we heat the mixture to 90C  we will get a vapor phase (36% of the total) with 40% ethanol. That would allow a greater efficiency in the process  but we have got to go 80C if we want 60% ethanol vapor.

So  if we separate the vapor phase  and drive it to 80C  we will get in the new system a vapor phase (50% of the total) with 60% ethanol. Overall  we got 17% of the original mixture as 60% ethanol in this two-step distillation without adding ethanol
0	Heat up the mixture to a temperature where the tie line hit the vapor line at 60% ethanol-40% percent water. Route the vapor to another chamber and cool down the vapor. You would then have 60% ethanol - 40% water.

As the vapor (rich in ethanol) is being extracted  the % of ethanol will increase in the original mixture. The fractional ethanol line will start moving to the right until it hits about 95% ethanol. At this concentration  the liquid goes completely from liquid to vapor. You cannot have the ethanol concentration any higher.
0	we can divide our solution using distillation   cause boiling temperature of water differs from boiling temperature of ethanol. 
but we can`t use distillation to reach completely pure ethanol  because near 96% etanol-4% water  the solution turn out to be azeotropic mixture  that can`t be divided in such a way cause when we change the pressure not only temperature is changed  but also the composition of our mixture. so we need other methods to do this.
0	Enter response here.
As the mixture is heated the vapor coming off will be rich in ethanol. The highest composition will be about 95% ethanol.
0	If we begin with a solution of 15% ethanol/85% water in the liquid phase and bring it to a boil  we will have a gas/liquid mixture where the liquid is relatively rich in water and the vapor is relatively rich in ethanol. We should boil this to the temperature where the tie line intersects the vaporus (?) line at 60% ethanol  and our gas will be 60% ethanol and 40% water. If we want it as a liquid  we can recondense it after physically separating it from the liquid.

We cannot reach a pure composition of 100% ethanol because we will simply approach the eutectic line around 95% ethanol if we repeat the process several times.


0	From 15 percent ethanol to 85 percent  you need to decrease the amount of water (to increase the concentration of ethanol).

Ethanol's MP = 78.5 degrees C  while Water's MP = 100 degrees C.


0	Fractional distillation can be used to enrich the ethanol solution. The phase diagram for alcohol-water mixtures hold true up to alcohol concentrations of about 95.6 percent. At this concentration the two substances quit boiling separately (the alcohol in the vapour phase is no longer more concentrated than in the liquid phase)  and fractional distillation no longer works. 
0	Heat the 15% ethanol enough to get into the liquid and vapor region of the phase diagram. The composition of the vapor is given by the right side of the tie line at whatever temperature you are at  and that composition will be greater than 15%.  Physically separate the vapor from the liquid (with a pipe for example)  and then lower the temperature so it condenses.  You now have a liquid at a higher concentration of ethanol than before. Do it again  and the concentration will increase again. Continue until the concentration reaches 60 percent. You can continue this with diminishing returns as you move to the right in the L+V region of the phase diagram. The results diminish because the L+V portion of the phase diagram gets smaller and smaller  so it's hard to have a condition where you have a mix of vapor and liquid  which you need for this scheme to work.   
0	Enter response here.an increase in temperature and reduction in pressure would enable an enrichment however the 100%solution is not possible due to the limited solubility of the elements
0	By heating the 15% ethanol solution to a temperature where more ethanol than water had vaporised  it should be possible to condense the vapor to obtain a 60% ethanol solution.

This process could not produce a completely pure ethanol solution as a point exists where the ethanol and water solution has the same composition in liquid form and in vapor form.
0	A vertical line at the 85 percent water represents the start point.  A horizontal tie line intersects the water liquid to vapor line at the 40 percent water line.  Holding temp and pressure at the 85 percent water line will over time allow more ethanol to turn to liquid than water.  Once the ethanol concentration reaches 60 percent it's rate of evaporation and condensation will be equal.  The water rate of evaporation and condensation will also be equal.   With this method the best you can hope to get is 60 percent ethanol.

Distillation is a separation process for a mixture of liquids or oils. In this case the ethanol-water mixture to be separated is added to a distilling pot where it is heated to the boiling point of each component. Lower boiling component(ethanol) will preferentially vaporize first. This vapor passes into a distilling head and then into a condenser. Within the condenser the vapor is cooled and it liquefies. The resulting liquid is then collected in a receiving flask. So starting with a 15% ethanol - 85% water composition the ethanol distills first and is collected thereby increasing the concentration of the mixture to about 60% ethanol-40% water composition  as the water distills after the ethanol it can be regulated to get the appropriate composition.


Furthermore  this procedure cannot be used to get a purity of 100% ethanol because the distillation vapor will be a mixture enriched in the lower boiling component(ethanol)  but still containing some of the higher boiling component(water). As the distillation proceeds  the liquid in the distilling pot will have a greater  and greater percentage of higher boiling component(water) if not stopped.




0	Heat the liquid to about 80 degrees and extract the vapor by destillation. This vapor content contains about 60 procent ethanol. 100 percent ethanol can not be reached from an original 15 percent liquid because any tie line can only reach a max of about 95 percent ethanol.
0	I would use distillation. Warm the mixture of alcohol and water to convert the liquid to a vapor primarily consisting of alcohol. This happens because alcohol has a lower boiling point than water. The alcohol is collected by condensation through a cold condenser above the heated liquid. Collection should be stopped before the temperature of the reaches the boiling point of water. I would stop at 85 or 90 degrees C based on the diagram above.

Water and ethanol interact through hydrogen bonding to produce and azeotrope (the small  bounded region) which has a lower boiling point than a simple mixture of alcohol and water in which there is no interaction. 
0	We can enrich quantity of ethanol with vaporizing solution  and then condensing it. 
We cann't rich more than 85 percent of ethanol by this method because we system in this conditions have eutectic  and vapor will have the same quantity of ethanol and water as the condensed solution 
0	From 15 percent ethanol to 85 percent  you need to decrease the amount of water (to increase the concentration of ethanol).

Ethanol's MP = 78.5 degrees C  while Water's MP = 100 degrees C.

You boil the ethanol-water mixture at a temperature where the ethanol becomes vapor. In distillation  the desired compound is more volatile than the solvent  and using a distillation column/set-up the more volatile vapor will be condensed (using a condenser) and will be collected in a separate container/flask.

Using lever rule  at 15% ethanol  trace the temperature (above 78.5) where the composition of vapor marks at 60% ethanol. By tracing  the temperature is near boiling point  about 80-81 degrees celsius. The vapor will then condense into a liquid of 60% ethanol and 40% water.

As you notice  the concentration of ethanol increases. If you repeat the same procedure by tracing at a temperature where a vapor will form  the concentration will reach near eutectic of the phase diagram  which is between 90-100%. At that point it is impossible to purify the sample even further  because the solution will either evaporate 100% or condensate 100% (using lever rule); no water will be left by distillating  therefore the concentration will remain the same.  If there is no eutectic  repetitive distillation will reach near 100%  but in this case  it is impossible.

0	in order to enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water you can lower the temperature. But if you continue to do this  you won't reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol  because in the end you should increase the temperature.
0	Heat the solution so that the composition of vapor is 60% ethanol and 40% water. The heating temperature can be found by drawing a vertical line at 60% ethanol and seeing where this line intersects the vapor line. The tie line perpendicular to this line will intersect the temperature axis at the right temperature. After the system reaches equilibrium  there will be vapor and liquid (with composition equal to where the horizontal line crosses the liquidus line). Remove the liquid  and cool the vapor. The condensed vapor will form a solution with the desired concentrations.

Pure ethanol cannot be obtained because repeated distillation cycles would eventually give a solution of composition at the point where the two "leaves" of the diagram meet at a point: the liquid and the vapor would be in dynamic equilibrium with one another  but removing the liquid and condensing the vapor would not increase the concentration. On the other hand  if presented with a solution with ethanol concentration greater than that at which the leaves join  one could repeatedly heat the solution  aspirate the vapor   heat the reserved solution  and so on  and come very close to 100%  but not actually reach it.

0	It is necessary to heat the initial solution to the boiling point and lead the process of boiling until the steam will condense at the ~80 C.

Azeotrope of water and ethanol contains 96% of ethanol and boils at 78 C. This explains the industrial concentration of ethyl alcohol: this is an azeotrope and it can not be divided into fractions by simple distillation.
0	If the 15% mixture is heated  the resulting vapor will be rich in ethanol. The vapor could then be collected and cooled  forming a liquid that has a higher percentage of ethanol than the original solution.
When a solution containing a high percentage of ethanol is heated the vapor will be of similar composition to the liquid and so further enrichment is not possible.
0	Enter response here.Here we can make the composition of  ethanol large by boiling the solution and then condense it. Then again boil it and condense it.By doing this the concentration of ethanol increases in the condensed solution as ethanol is more volatile. Here we can't make 100% ethanol solution as there is some water present in the vapor.
0	by increasing the temperature and decreasing the pressure. 
0	By increasing the temperature you could increase the volume of the ethanol faster than the water  and thus you are able to get a 60:40 percent concentration. However  no matter how much you heat it  there will still be some water in the ethanol and it will never be pure

To enrich the solution with water you could heat the solution but when you do that the etanol vaporize.  
0	An azeotrope is a liquid mixture of two or more components having a unique constant boiling point and fixed  and that passing into the vapor state behaves as a pure compound  or as if it were a single component. To get a purer compound will need to use special resources such as azeotropic distillation. For example  if subjected to a simple distillation a mixture of 50% ethanol 50% evaporating the mixture obtained two products: pure water in background (~ 25% ethanol)  and a distillate with a higher ethanol concentration (~ 74%). If this mixture is distilled again a 2nd distillate obtained with an ethanol concentration of about 82%. A 3 rd distillation distillate will throw an ~ 87% ethanol. As shown in the figure  successive distillations to approximate the distillate composition of the azeotrope (95% ethanol)  but never pure ethanol.

0	Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Some water will still be present in the extracted and condensed vapour though  so this procedure must be carried out many times at lower and lower temperatures to continue to improve the yield. The % can not exceed that of the Eutectic composition (around 95%)  as the combined liquid goes straight to the gaseous phase at this point.
0	As we can see in the diagram  the initial solution exists as liquid at a temperature ~ 80C  and the final solution  at ~ 70C. If we need to enrich a solution of 15% ethanol - 85% water to a composition of 60% ethanol - 40% water  we have to decrease the temperature of the solution from 80C to approximately 70C at the same time exposing the initial solution to a source of ethanol vapor in order to get more ethanol into the solution.
0	Heat that mixture to about 80C than the vapor contains those 60 % alcohol and just 40 percent water. Then condense tha vapor and collect it.

One cannot reach 100 % purity since both phases form an eutecticum at a composition of 96 % alcohol and 4 % water. At this point the composition of the liquid is identical to the composition of the vapor  therefore no dispropotionation can take place.

Simple distillation is a procedure by which two liquids with different boiling points can be separated. Simple distillation (the procedure outlined below) can be used effectively to separate liquids that have at least fifty degrees difference in their boiling points. As the liquid being distilled is heated  the vapors that form will be richest in the component of the mixture that boils at the lowest temperature. Purified compounds will boil  and thus turn into vapors  over a relatively small temperature range (2 or 3C); by carefully watching the temperature in the distillation flask  it is possible to affect a reasonably good separation. As distillation progresses  the concentration of the lowest boiling component will steadily decrease. Eventually the temperature within the apparatus will begin to change; a pure compound is no longer being distilled. The temperature will continue to increase until the boiling point of the next-lowest-boiling compound is approached. When the temperature again stabilizes  another pure fraction of the distillate can be collected. This fraction of distillate will be primarily the compound that boils at the second lowest temperature. This process can be repeated until all the fractions of the original mixture have been separated
0	Using destilation
0	Heat the solution and capture the vapour. Condense it to give an enriched solution. Repeat the process until the desired composition is achieved. The maximum concentration achievable is given by the minimum at 95% concentration in the phase diagram.
0	The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. The resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.

From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%. Additionally  at a concentration of ~95% ethanol  the phase diagram shows an eutectic  meaning both components transition to vapor at the same temperature point. Hence  no further gains in concentration are possible beyond ~95%.

0	A.
Heat the liquid to vaporize some  but not all  of it.  Adjust the temperature to balance the amount and composition of the vapor.  Separate and condense the vapor.  If the composition is less than 60% ethanol  repeat using the new liquid.

B.
From the phase diagram (and the lever rule):  Given a liquid composed of less than the critical composition (say 95% ethanol)  the composition of any phase reachable by heating is also less than 95% ethanol.
0	At around 80 degrees C the 15:85 solution will start to vapourise. Ethanol has the lower boiling point and the vapour portion of the two phase mix will be ethanol rich. As the temperature increases further the ratio of ethanol to water in the vapour phase will decrease. At a certain temperature the ratio will be at the desired composition. The vapour can be siphoned off into a seperate vessel where the vapour can be cooled and the condensate can be collected.

This cannot be used to get a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol as at 80 degrees C there will be at percentage of water that has sufficient energy to enter the vapour phase due to the Boltzman distribution of energies. So whilst the vapour will be ethanol rich  it will not be pure.




0	You can take the 15/85 composition at temperature of 90 degrees celsium and cool it down to 80 degrees. Then you can have a tie line which will encompass the needed 60/40 composition. Though this procedure can not be used to get 100 ethanol because it can not solute all the water in itself.
0	First increase temperature to above 100 degree to turn the solution in to vapor  then decrease the temperature of the vapor to around 85 degree  since at that temperature  the substance left in vapor would be the 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. We than collect those vapor and condense then to solution form.

This procedure could not be used to reach 100 percent ethanol because at boiling point of 100 percent ethanol   not only 100 percent ethanol exists in vapor form  but also the 70 percent ethanol - 30 percent water.
0	We could heat the solution above the boiling point and start cooling it. When all of the solution is still not condensed  the vapor will have a higher percentage of ethanol and the liquid will have a lower percentage of ethanol then the starting percentage. We can then remove the liquid  and the remaining solution will have a higher percentage of ethanol. When we get to the eutectic point  with cooling the vapor will completely turn to liquid so the process will no longer be possible. Above the eutectic point  the reverse will happen.
0	On the plot  the position of the 60% ethanol is below the 15% ethanol One way of acheiving this is by reducing the temperature(or pressure) of the system(solution). By doing this will increase the solubility of ethanol in the solution and hence increase its concentration from 15% to 60%.
This method will not be feasible in producing 100% pure ethanol since for this to occur  the partial pressure of ethanol in water must equate to the athmospheric pressure which is very hard to acheive.
0	black magic
0	We should heat up the solution up to about 83 C. At that temperature we'll have some small percent of the liquid gone into vapor. According to the phase diagram that vapor will have about 60% ethanol at that temperature. If we take the vapor out and cool it down somewhere else we'll have the liquid solution of the required ethanol-water composition.

We can't make 100% ethanol using this procedure because after we've got 95% ethanol solution there'll be no increase in it's concentration in the vapor.
0	Heat the mixture at the temperature where composition of vapor is 60% ethanol and then cool again the vapor to reach the liquid phase.

0	As both has different boiling point  solution should heated to change composition. 
0	a) Water and ethanol under certain conditions can form an azeotropic mixture. This is a schematic of their phase diagram which is also known as minimum boiling or positive azeotrope. Starting with a mixture of 15%ethanol - 85% water and by simple distillation we can condense the mixture to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water because at the beginning of the distillation the distillate will be water. 

b) The main characteristic of this mixture is that it s composition is unchanged by distillation when it reaches the minimum boiling point and in this case at approximately 78oC and has a concentration of approximately 95% ethanol and 5% water. Thus  it will continue to boil and produce vapors with constant composition (95% ethanol and 5% water)
0	According to the diagram  if you heat a solution of water and ethanol  when the temperature reaches the liquidus  vapor starts forming in equilibrium with liquid. The tie line at that temperature corresponds to a vapor composition of about 60% of ethanol. If that vapor is separated and cooled  you can get a solution of about 60% ethanol - 40% water.

There is no temperature in the graph at which a tie line crosses the 15% ethanol solution and joins a vapor compositon of 100% ethanol  so it is not possible to obtain a vapor free from water.

0	By heating the mixture ethanol will concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquid.  Condensing (cooling) appart the enriched mixture in vapor phase will increase ethanol fraction as a liquid mixture.

The procedure could not be used to reach 100% ethanol due to its higher boiling point than a mixture with about 95% ethanol.
0	Heating the solution to the correct temperature should cause a greater quantity of ethanol to shift to the vapor state than water  using the phase diagram to find the temperature at which the correct proportions will result. This vapor solution can than be condensed back to a liquid state  if desired. This cannot be used to reach 100% ethanol because there will always be some water vaporized along with the ethanol.
0	Try this
0	You have to lower the temperature until around 65 C to get the right ratio. You will not able to get 100% ethanol solution  because lowest line (liquid border) does not reach 100% axis  it reachs only until euthetic point.
0	The boiling point for ethanol is lower than for water. For a 15% ethanol concentration  the phase diagram shows that the liquid is in equilibrium with the vapor above approximately 80 degrees Celsius.

Using the lever rule  we can see that a 60% concentration of ethanol corresponds to a temperature of about 85 degrees Celsius. One can then let the vapor diffuse into a different container and condense  forming a liquid enriched in ethanol.

This method cannot be used to obtain 100% ethanol because  as one can see in the phase diagram  the tie line for such high concentrations lie below the temperature of 80 degrees celsius. As soon as the temperature is high enough to create a vapor (at the 15% overall ethanol concentration)  the concentration of ethanol in the vapor is below 80%  and it decreases with increasing temperature.
0	1. First heat the mixture at 80 deg C and collect the vapor. Now condensate the vapor till all become liquid. The resultant mixture composition will be approximately 60% of ethanol  40% of water. 
0	One could distill it by decreasing temperature and collect ice (e.g. by condensation). Distillation would always reach pure ethanol  since some water would not be mixed into the vapor. 
0	you would boil the solution and then lower the temperature.  as more water drops out  the vapor becomes more ethanol rich as it follows the curve to the right until it hits the percentage you are looking for.  you couldn't reach 100% with this because it would stop at the eutectic point  about 95%.
0	When the mixture of ethanol and water is boiled the steam will have higher ethanol molar fraction. According to the phase diagram  if we start from a mixture of 15% ethanol we obtain a mixture of about 60% ethanol.
We could not use this diagram to obtain 100% ethanol because of the eutectic point. Acording to this  we can obtain onlly 95% of ethanol. The steam of this mixture will contain the same molar fracction.
0	In this phase diagram is an example of that of positive azeotropic mixture  of minimum boiling water ethanol system.  In the diagram  above the locus curve water and ethanol exists as vapor and below the curve both as liquids. The area inside the curve represents an equilibrium mixture of both. If we plot a tie line in the centre we will get a 50-50 mixture of both components. The distillation of this mixture will produce the product closer in proportion of the component near the azeotrop  which is ethanol here. 

In the given sample and at the given temperature  represents a 15% ethanol and 85% water system. It can be enriched in ethanol by reducing the temperature to the required level. On lower temperature  the tie line indicates higher proportion if ethanol and lower proportion of water. On lowering the temperature  the tie line moves to right giving more ethanol from in the vapor phase.  Continuous distillations can lead to ethanol of purity near to azeotrop but not higher than that. If we add more ethanol to the system  the resulting solution will contain ethanol slightly higher than the azeotrop  but poorer in purity than the original solution  leaving more ethanol in solution. 

Another way to increase the purity of the components distilled at the azeotropic point is the addition of a third component to shift the equilibrium point. For example  to the azeotropic boiling solution at 78C  which distills as 96% ethanol and 4% water  the addition of the third component benzene can remove the water leading to 99.5% pure ethanol. 

In the case of azeotropic mixtures it is not possible to purify the component above the azeotropic point  therefore we cannot obtain 100% ethanol from an azeotropic mixture of ethanol-water system

2.	 An eutecticum is here present at 98 %

0	We can take the given solution and heat it  then ... collect the vapors and condense them. 

Because ethanol has a lower vapor pressure  there will be more ethanol vapors than water vapor in the vapor phase on heating the solution. Hence condensing this vapor will result in a greater fraction of ethanol. If the fraction collected is not enriched enough in ethanol  this condensed solution can now be heated  the vapors collected and condensed into another flask. Repeating this process should result in the desired fraction. 

Unfortunately  doing this multiple times will not lead to 100% pure ethanol. This is because an azeotrope (a constant boiling mixture) forms at a certian compostion as indicated by the meeting point of the curves near 95% ethanol. This means  that once this liquid composition forms  on heating this solution the vapors formed will have the same compostion as the liquid (and not more enriched in ethanol like before). Hence recondensing this vapor will simply result in the same liquid composition. In other words  water cannot be completely separated from ethanol by this process. 

0	First you have to heat the solution up to 90 and then to lower the temperature to the value of the curve. Thus  the solution will enrich to a composition of 60 percent ethanol-40 percent water  after cooling it. 

You cannot reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an azeotrope. The maximum composition you can reach is the composition in the azeotrope.
0	Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C. There will be an equilibrium of a liquid (~10:90) and a vapor (~60:40).
Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution.
0	To be able to enrich a solution one should heat the initial solution to evaporation temperature of little less than 100 C  then gradually decrease the temperature. During the whole process the vapor must be taken away from the jar with solution (so it has to be opened). When temperature will be gradually decreased to 80C the experimenter-distiller should stop  seal the jar and let it cool off. 100 percent of ethanol can not be achieved because at some point between 0.9 - 1 fractions of ethanol the water and ethanol will evaporate at the same speed and thus composition will stay at that point of approximately 0.96 of ethanol. 
0	water and ethanol mixture have the constant lowest boiling point.
when we heat the liquid mixture of water and ethanol the liquid in the botton and the temperature increases. It will be less and less ethanol in it and the gasoline on the top will get cooler  and the percentage of ethanol increase.
after a period of time the liquid contain mostly the water while the gasoline contian about 95% of ethanol and water and ethanol reach the constant boiling point.
so we can not get the pure ethanol gasoline

0	By separating the liquid phase  rich in water  from the gas phase  rich in ethanol. The distillation is the most usual process used to get this split done. In this case  multiple plates of equilibrium or packed columns are used in order to reach this separation.
Conventional processes can not achieve a complete separation between ethanol and water as they form an azeotroph in the composition of 0.96 in ethanol. In this case both the vapor and liquid phase have the same composition  so separation is not possible.
0	We can add to 15% some concentrated solution ethanol/water with fixed concentration.

100 percent ethanol can't be synthesized because  water and ethanol form the mixture that can't be differed by distillation; such kind of mixture is called azeotrope. Water concentration in ethanol azeotrope is about 3-4 percent  we can the this meaning on the diagram.
0	Enter response here.
To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.
Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which we can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol.
