		By raising the temperature of the ethanol-water solution into the range
		of the two phase region, one is able to separate the system into an
		ethanol-rich vapor phase and a water-rich liquid phase. The vapor phase can be
		separated from the liquid and collected. The vapor can then be continually
		cooled and heated through additional distillation steps, separating off the
		ethanol-rich vapor phase until the desired composition is reached.

		The procedure could not be used to completely purify ethanol from water
		because of the congruent vaporization point at approximately 95% ethanol. As
		one moves across the two-phase region to the left of this point purification is
		able to occur due to the presence of the two-phase region. At this point
		however, the system will no longer phase separate as the temperature is varied,
		hence purification cannot continue.
