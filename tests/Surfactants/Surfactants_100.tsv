0	The solution will appear 'cloudy' at 1.  The domain has shifted from a surface phenomenon to an aggregation phenomenon.
0	When concentration is small  molecules are spread on the surface and make surface tension smaller with increasing concentration of the surfacant. At about .02% concentration  is high enough fo micelles to form. Micelles are small balls of surfacant molecules (hydrophobic parts are inside  so they don't touch water and hydrophilic parts are outside)  that prevent further change of surface tension. New molecules just join or form new micelles. Molecules in a micelle change only surface tension on the surface of the micelle  so surface tension of the solution at 1% is almost constant.
0	There are a lot of micells formed at 1 weight% of surfactant. Surface tension almost stopped to change at 0.01 weight% since all surface available in this experiment was filled by surfactant. Since that point  adding more surfactant will create more micells without changing surface tension.
0	The surfactant will not be dissolved at .001 weight percent   but will be dissolved into the water at 1 weight percent.  There has to be enough surfactant to lower the surface tension on the water to the point where the surfactant will dissolve into the water.
0	In the field of concentration since 0 till 0.01% surface tension are decreasing in linear proportionaluty with increasing of concentration. But in Critical concentration of Micell (CMC) no tension change observed.
0	The solution at 1% will be very turbid compared to the solution at 0.001% because the critical point  the point where the surface tension essentially plateaus  is shown to be around 0.015%. After the critical point  the turbidity rises. When a surfactant is added to a polar solvent like water  the hydrophilic heads are exposed the water while the hydrophobic tails point away from the water. This causes the surface tension to lower until the concentration reaches a point  the critical points  at which the surfactant begins to form structures like micelles and tubes.
0	In the low percentage zone the micelles are actively forming  until the point of about 0.03 is reached  from where on the solvent stays rather stable and much less new structures form and this phase should be less transparent then low percentage solvent.
0	it will be blue-ish
0	As the concentration of surfactant increases as a function of wt % of water (presumed) solution  the surface tension is decreases until it reaches the critical micelle concentration  at which point there is minimal subsequent effect. this occurs because the hydrophobic component of the surfactant seeks the water interface  and separates itself from the water  while the hydrophillic portion remains in the water. The surfactant decreases the surface energy portion of the surface tension  thus lowering the surface tension. The presence of the surfactant also scatters light due to diffraction of light   thus creating a slight bluish tint to the surface.

Further increase in concentration may cause the orientation and close packing of the elongated micelles into hexagonal arrays; this is a liquid crystalline state termed the middle phase or hexagonal phase. With some surfactants  further increase of concentration results in the separation of a second liquid crystalline state  the neat phaseor lamellar phase.In some surfactant systems another liquid crystalline state  the cubic phase  occurs between the middle and neat phases.
0	 The trend of the change in the surface tension changes when the concentration of surfactants arrives in the critical micelle concentration  at this point  the surface tension stops decreasing and keeps constant. In the points before the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 0.001  you can't observe micelles so  the turbidity is equal 0. In the points after the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 1  you can observe micelles so  the turbidity is greather than 0  because the micelles present in the solution can scatter the light.

0	At approximately 0.015 (point of changing gradient) the critical mycell concentration (cmc) is reached. Below the cmc addition of surfactant lowers the surface tension of the water. Above the cmc surfactant molecules organise themselves into mycells - groups of surfactant moecules arranged in such a way as to organise their hydrophilic heads into the water and hide their hydrophobic tails within the mycell.  The solution will appear cloudy at concentrations above the cmc.
0	As the weight percent of surfactant increases to a certain point called the critical micelle concentration or c.m.c.  the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant molecules align themselves at the surface  with their hydrophilic ends pointing into the solution and forming bonds with water molecules that would otherwise be at the surface and therefore less bonded. Above the c.m.c.  about 0.02 weight percent in this case  the surfactant begins to form micelles. As these are suspended within the solution and not necessarily at the surface  the surface tension does not decrease much as concentrations are increased beyond this point. The presence of micelles will give solutions with a concentration greater than the c.m.c. a turbid  somewhat bluish appearance whereas solutions with a concentration less than the c.m.c. will have no micelles and will be clear.
0	When adding surfactants  surface tension is decreasing  up to a point - critical micelle point - where surfactants form structures with the hydrophobic group in the middle  and hydrophilic group in the center. After that point  surface tension won't change by much. Solution at a concentration of 0.001 weight percent will be clear  but at 1  it will be cloudy.

0	- Adding surfactant to an aqueous solution will decrease its surface tension because the hydrophobic tails of molecules of this surfactant will stick out of the surface of the aqueous solution and partially screen the tendency of the surface molecules of the aqueous solution to attract and bond to each other.
- The surface tension of the aqueous solution will be constant after a certain weight percent of surfactant is reached(nearly 0.01). At this point  the screening effect of the surfactant is maximum and micelles begin to form.
- 0.001 wt% is relatively clear because it doesn't contain micelles (macro-molecules).
- 1 wt% is turbid because it contains micelles (macr-molecules) that are big enough to scatter light.

Before the CMC point (0.015 %wt) the surface tension decreases steadily with increasing surfactant concentration. After this point  the concentration decreases but with a lower rate.
The CMC point is where the concentration of surfactant is enough to micelles spontaneously form in solution.
As surfactant concentration increases  the surface coverage of surfactant molecules increases and the maximun coverage is reached at CMC. At that point  molecules begin to agregate into micelles. Beyond this point any new formation of micelles will have minor effects on surface tension.

As the concentration of surfactant increases  more of the surfactant is present at the surface of the solution.  The surfactant disrupts the bonding of the water molecules at the surface  and so decreases the surface tension.  Above a certain concentration (in this case about 0.02 wt%) the surfactant starts to self-assemble into micelles- organisations of many surfactant molecules within the solution.  Less of the added surfactant is therefore available to reduce the surface tension  so the reduction in surface tension per unit added surfactant decreases.

At 1% concentration  it forms an aggregate.
0	As concentration of surfactant increases the surface tension of water decreases as long as it hinders interaction between water molecules. But after critical concentration of approximately 0.2 weight percent micels start to form in the bulk of water and addition of surfactant affects surface tension much less. Appearance of water also can change as long as micels decrease its transparency an change hue due to different refraction index.
0	The surfactant initially forms a surface layer on the top of the water. This reduces the surface tension of the water-surfactant mixture. As the concentration is increased there are more surfactant molecules per area of the surface  this continues to reduce the surface tension of the mixture. Once the critical micelle concentration is reached  the surface has become saturated in surfactant. Adding addition surfactant now begins to form micelles suspended in the mixture. The change in surface tension with increased surfactant now becomes much smaller. As the micelles approach the size of visible light  Rayleigh scattering happens and the blue light is scattered more giving the mixture a blue tint. As the surfactant concentration is increases  more micelles form increase the amount of light scattered and the turbidity of the mixture increases. 
0	This the answer.
0	When surfactant molecules are added  these molecules spread over all surface in one layer  it's reduce the surface tension of an aqueous solution. But when you put enough amount of surfactant molecules  they start to aggregate and form micelles and don't influence the surface tension.
0	Addition of the surfactant reduces the surface tension.  At a concentration just above 0.1% (the c.m.c.)  the surfactant spontaneously forms micelles and the reduction in surface tension essentially stays constant as more surfactant is added.  
At low concentrations (e.g. 0.0001%) the solution will be colourless but at concentrations above the c.m.c.  (e.g. 1%) the micelles will diffract light & turbidity will develop.
0	   As more surfactant is added to a concentration of 0.001 the surface tension is lowered. At a concentration of  0.3 it reaches the critical micelle concentration. It starts to form micelles and the surface tension barely changes being almost the same at a concentration of 0.1.
0	Adding surfactant to the solution will decrease the surface tension until a certain point. At that point  concentration of surfactant is high enough to allow micelle formation.
At 0.001 wt%  nothing is visible.
At 1 wt% the solution scatters light because of the micelles.
0	Due to the position of the hydrophilic head group 
0	the solution is more soluble in water
0	(at STP in pure water) 
The introduction of surfactant to the aqueous solution shows a dramatic decrease in surface tension. This is due to the surfactant partitioning into the interface (and arresting oil if present) to reduce the free energy of the interface. This is measured as surface tension. When the coverage of the interface with surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. Whilst there is still a decrease in the surface tension  the surfactant is soluble and free to move about in an aqueous solution at it's lowest energy state. When to concentration of surfactant reaches a critical concentration (CMC)  the solubility of the surfactant has been reached. (0.01 wt% in this graph). At this point  the energy required to keep the surfactant in solution is no longer at its lowest state  so to decrease the free energy the surfactant precipitates out of solution by forming micelles  giving a bluish the appearance to the solution. Subsequent addition of surfactant causes no significant change (virtually none) in the surface tension and only adds to the formation of more or larger micelle formations.  (1 wt% on the graph)
0	Surfactants reduce the surface tension in a solution  because they seperate the solution and the air around it.

When there is no more room for the surfactants in the air-solution surface  the surface tension cannot be reduced anymore  a point which is called the Critical Micelle Concentration.
At this point  the surfactants start to arrange themselves in various forms  including Micelles (Spheres).

In the graph  we easily see that the CMC is around 0.3wt%.
Above that point  the surfactants will start aggregating into Micelles.
0	Above a 0.011 wt% of surfactant  the surfactant molecules are forming micelles. Above this level  the solution becomes increasingly turbid and develops a bluish tint due to light scattering. Below 0.011 wt%  the surfactant molecules are in a single layer with the hydrophilic ends in the aqueous liquid and the hydrophobic ends sticking in the air. The aqueous solution should be clear.
0	The surface tension reduces until the surfactants are clumped together at a critical point. When this happens the clump will influence the surface tension differently than the dispersed surfactants because of the difference in conformation of the molecules. As the weight percentage increases the solution will acquire a bluish tint.
0	At low concentrations (approximately below 0.01%) surfactant will seggregate to the surface of the water  and its hydrophilic end will stay in contact with the surface of water  lowering its surface tension. Surface tension lowers to a limit with increasing concentration of the surfactant. That limit is the CMC (Critical Micelles concentration)  for concentrations above that limit the surfactant will start forming micelles  and thus the increasing on the effect on surface tension will stop. Above the CMC surface tension remains almost constant because any increase inthe concentration of surfacttant will form micelles  will not seggregate to the surface. 

Those micelles  with diameters between 3 and 50 nanometers  will scatter light passing through the solution  making water white or blue.
0	At the critical micelle concentration at around 0.01% weight percentage  the surfactants aggregate into micelles instead of continuing to reduce the surface tension of the liquid. From 0.001 weight percent to1 weight  the solution will change colour.
0	In. oo1 you have a high surface tension decreases high as 35 dynes/cm then this then the slope becomes smaller until reaching an almost constant at a concentration of 1%
0	As we add more amount of surfactant decreases the surface tension. This is because the surfactant is capable of dispersing liquid molecules into small droplets.
From what we call critical micellas concentration (MCM)  superfical tension becomes constant. This is because from this surfactant concentration  the surfactant molecules begin to form micelles.
The differences between the two concentrations of surfactant are that from the MCM:
1. The solution begins to have a bluish color (turbidity increases) because it scatters light.
2. Decreases the equivalent conductivity of the solution.
3. Increases the solubility of the solution.
4. Decreases the self diffusion of the solution.
0	As the concentration of surfactant increases in the solution  the surface tension of water drops linearly  as the surfactant molecules crowd the gas-liquid interface. This lowers the number of atoms of water/area on the surface  thus lowering the surface energy and thus the surface tension. However  eventually a point is reached (the cmc)  where the surfactant molecules preferentially form micelle structures instead of crowding the surface  so the tension barely decreases beyond this point. 

Micelles scatter light  so a solution with high surfactant concentration would appear slightly blue in colour.
0	-
0	As the wt% increases  the surface tension will reach a  point where it no longer changes much. This is the critical micelle concentration  where particles will start to form micelles.  At 1%  the solution may have a bluish tint compared to 0.001% due to the fact of how they diffract light differently.
0	Initially  at a concentration of 0.0001  the surfactant molecule is situated on the surface of the solution.  The hydrophobic tails sticking out into the air.  As the concentration increases thee surface tension decreases until a critical point is reached at which point the surfactants spontaneously form into micelles.   As the concentration increases the surface tension of the micelles remains relatively constant.

0	Enter essay here.  As the weight % surfactant concentration approaches 0.02%  the surfactant reaches the CMC value for the surfactant.  Further increase in surfactant concentration does not reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solution.  The solution at 1% weight will appear cloudy compared to a clear solution at the 0.0001% weight solution.
0	For a concentration of the surfactant below its cmc the surface tension drops linearly with increasing concentration of the surfactant. The surfactant is hardly soluable in the water but sticks on the surface with its hydrophile ends inside and its hydrophobe ends outside of the water. The solution is transparent. At the cmc of about 0.015 wt% the surfactants start to organise themselves into micelles. The surface tension does not drop much any more. Instead the solubility increases and the micelles dissolve in the water. The solution starts to scatter the light and is not transparent any more. 
0	(at STP in pure water) 
The introduction of surfactant to the aqueous solution shows a dramatic decrease in surface tension. This is due to the surfactant partitioning into the interface (and arresting oil if present) to reduce the free energy of the interface. This is measured as surface tension. When the coverage of the interface with surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. Whilst there is still a decrease in the surface tension  the surfactant is soluble and free to move about in an aqueous solution at it's lowest energy state. When to concentration of surfactant reaches a critical concentration (CMC)  the solubility of the surfactant has been reached. (0.01 wt% in this graph). At this point  the energy required to keep the surfactant in solution is no longer at its lowest state  so to decrease the free energy the surfactant precipitates out of solution by forming micelles. Subsequent addition of surfactant causes no significant change (virtually none) in the surface tension and only adds to the formation of more or larger micelle formations.  (1 wt% on the graph)
0	When the surfactant concentration in the water reaches a determined value micelles starts to forming in way to aggregate molecules of the substance. So  because the surfactant is no longer completely spreading itself in the water surface the aqueous surface tension stops changing. The system  at 1 wt.%  diffracts light  is no more transparent like when the surfactant conc. was 0.001 wt.%. 
0	Surface tension decreases as surfactant is added. Surfactants usually contain hydrophobic chains with hydrophilic heads. These hydrophilic parts can now replace some water molecules on the surface. As a result there are less cohesive forces between water molecules on the surface due to the interjection of solute particles. This reduces the surface tension. 

As more and more surfactant is added  there is continuous decrease in surface tension until the surface tension reaches a minimum and does not change after the maximum number of solute particles that can be present at the surface along with solvent is reached.

As far as appearances go  in general  solutions with high surface tension will have droplet like appearance (or more viscous) while low surface tension liquids will be more smoother at the surface.


0	Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules with hydrophobic head at one end and hydrophilic head another end. On addition of such a surfactant to water  it lowers the surface tension of the water. The hydrophilic end gets attached to the water while the hydrophobic end points away towards the air or towards other non-polar particles present.

It is the general rule that as the concentration of the surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. In the graph it is evident that as the concentration of the surfactant increase  the surface tension decreases  so the line is slopping down. In the graph after certain concentration  the line becomes a plateau.   This is because  after a particular point there is no change in surface tension with increase in concentration of the surfactant. What happen here is that all the molecules aggregates together spontaneously to form micelles. After this critical micelles concentration (CMC)  there is no change in surface tension with addition of surfactants. That is the reason why the plot goes straight after a continuous decrease until certain concentration. 

If the graph was plotted with 0.001% Vs 1% weight  the shape of the graph would remain the same. But the line would be starting from a surface tension below 50 and will decrease continuously until the same point on the original plot and then the surface tension would remain constant giving straight line parallel to the X axis  as in the original plot since the CMC remains the same. 

0	Through hydrophobic part couples trying to reach the surface  reducing the surface tension  but at a certain concentration of vapor form micelles because the surface tension does not change.
0	As surfactants are added to the solution  they remain on the surface due to the hydrophilic groups and reduce the surface tension.  Once the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached at about 0.013%  the surfactants arrange themselves into micelles which can then diffuse throughout the volume of the solution.  At this point the solution becomes turbid due to light scattering off the micelles  and the solubility of the surfactant increases due to being able to diffuse into the entire volume of the solution rather than just the surface.
0	At a graph  by adding surfactants the aqueous surfase tention lowers - i.e hydrophobic group of surfactant lies on a surface. It makes sense to a point  at which graph changes its direction. This point is a critical micella concentration point - surfactants starts to stick together.
0	The surface tension decreases with the increase in concentration until it reaches the Critical Micelle concentration where micelles formation starts to take place due to which the surface tension becomes constant and shows no further decrease. 
The solution will look like a colloid and will be bluish in color due to scattering of light by the particles of the solution.

0	As soon as the surfactant reaches a specific concentration  it starts to aggregate. It causes that it stops changing surface tension and it starts forming micelles. In the video professor Cima mentioned a critical micelles concentration (CMC) which in case of ionic surfactants is about 10^-3 to 10^-2. That also corresponds with the graph above  so it is probable that the graph is related to the ionic surfactant. As for the appearance  the more surfactant you put into the water after the CMC  the less transparent the solution will be  since there will be more "impurities" (small particles  micelles) that will scatter the light.
0	As the concentration of surfactants in the water increases the surface tension decreases because the surfactants arrange themselves on the surface so that the hydrophilic end is in the water and the hydrophobic out of it. But at the CMC surface tension decreases more gradually because the surfactants begin forming micelles. At .0001 weight percent the solution while be clear but at 1 which is greater then the CMC it will have a blueish color because of the micelles.
0	- Surfactants are compounds that reduce the surface tension of water.
- A surfactant molecule is amphiphilic and interferes with the hydrogen bonding in water and reduces the cohesiveness.
- The more the surfactant  less the surface tension. 
- At .001 wt% the surface tension is very high whereas at 1 wt% it is low. This is due to more interference with hydrogen bonds in water. 

0	When we increase the concentration of surfactant the surface tension drops until the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached. Above this point  surface tension is roughly constant (about 35 dynas/cm)  so the difference in tension surface at 0.05% and 1% weight is no significant  but if we have a 0.001% concentration  tension is about 45 dynas/cm.

0	Surfactants contains amphiphilies which contains polar water soluble end & other end with non polar tails which is non water loving & do not dissolve in water.When surfactant is added to water solution  it's surface tension starts  decreasing.At a certain point further addition of surfactant does not reduce surface tension any further.At this point surfactant molecules starts joining together to form aggregate spontaneously   making  micelles . At this point concentration is called CMC.In the given figure at 0.001 weight percentage surface tension is about 50 dynes/cm which further goes down with increase in weight percentage of surfactant upto weight percentage of approximately 0.011 & 35 dynes/cm of surface tension.After this point any further addition of surfactant does not reduce surface tension any further but starts formation of aggregates. This status continues even at a weight percentage of 1 also.Thus at weight percentage of 0.001 surface tension has a decreasing trend   however  at weight percentage of 1 & further more no decrease in surface tension is observed this is because further to CMC value surfactants starts making aggregates.
0	As weight percent of surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases because the surfactant bonds to the surface reducing the energy of the unbonded surface molecules.  At some critical point however the surface becomes saturated with surfactant and addition of more surfactant results in formation of micelles which leave the surface and enter the bulk fluid.  So at 0.001 weight percent  the surface has very little surfactant and high surface tension  but at 1 weight percent  the surface is saturated and the solution has micelles in it.



0	The surfactants will eventually form micelles  and that happens when the slope of the line changes. At 1% weight  the micelles will be visible [under a microscope]. At 0.001% weight  the surfactants won't be visible.
0	Below the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  the solution will be clear. The solution will be turbid above the CMC as the micelles will scatter light.
0	Solution will be more turbid as more surfactant is present.
0	It will differ in the critical micelle concentration  below this concentration you cant form micelles
0	that is because of the apperance of miscelles
0	Surfactants make superficial tension of water decrease  its value will go down as the concentration of surfactanct rises. 
This is true until a certain value of concentration of surfactanct  called critical micelle concentration (CMC). This is the concentration at which the molecules of surfactanct start to organize themselves as aggregates  micelles  leaving their hydrophilic part in contact with water and the hydrophobic part of the molecule to the inside of the micelle. 
From this value of concentration and up  surface tension will not decrease significantly.
The solution with a conc. of surfactanct beyond CMC will look different to water or a low conc. solution because micelles reflect light of diverse wavelenght so will give the solution some colour.
0	The surface tension rises when we add a small amount of surfactant. While we continue adding surfactant the surface tension is still growing up. When we reach a certain concentration  surface tension doesn't change because the surfactant is forming micelles.
0	Adding surfactant to water decrease surface tension until reach crytical micelle concentration. At this point  surfactant start forming micelles and  micelles scatter light. Up to crytical micelle concentration turbidity appear  and increasing surfactant concentration turbidity increase.  Thats why  0.001 weight  solution its clear and 1 weight its blue like  differing the appearence of the soluton
0	When we have .0001% weght percent  surface tension has a high value. But when wt is increases  surfactant starts to form micelles and surface tension is stoped to drop.
0	The solution starts with a surface tension of 60 dynes / cm and with increasing the amount of surfactant decreases the surface tension in the solution to a value of 35 dynes / cm by micelle formation. When the solution is saturated micelle formation ceases and the surface tension remains approximately constant in the solution. Through 0 001 to 1% of the solution changes to a more uniform appearance to an irregular appearance due to the presence of micelles
0	Let's consider the case whereby the concentration of the surfactant molecule increases from 0.001 weight percent (wt%) to 1 wt%. The aqueous solution will be initially clear/transparent. The surface tension of the solution will rapidly decrease as the concentration increases. Then at a certain level of concentration known as the CMC (Critical Micelle Concentration)  the surface tension remains largely unchanged as the concentration increases. Likewise  as the concentration reaches the CMC the solution becomes cloudy and the turbidity increases as the concentration increases.

The CMC concentration  occurs when the surfactant molecules exists in such quantity that they can aggregate into structures. For example  little spheres of Micelles  with the hydrophilic heads of the surfactant molecules forming a shell of a sphere  while the hydrophobic tails group together inside the shell because they are repulsed by the water molecules of the aqueous solution.

Because these micelles aggregate together  they block light; giving rise to the cloudiness.

0	Upon addition of surfactant up to .01 wt% the surface tension of aqueous solution goes down. Adding more surfactants gets the solution to critical micelle concentration  when surfactant molecules start spontaneously aggregationg with one another to form micelles. Formation of micelles makes solution appear cloudy.
0	The surface tension decreases when we increase the concentration of surfactant  until we reach a point of concentrationn (CMC) when the surfactant tends to create structures such as micelles  and the surface tension stops decreasing (that would be the 0.03  more or less). The solution with a 0.001weight percent of surfactant would be clearer than the one at 1 weight percent.
0	While adding more and more surfactant the surface tension decreases until it reaches the cmc-point (=point of critical micelle concentration). This is reached where th two lines in the diagram cross. At cmc the surfactants start to aggregate spontaneousely and form micelles. Because micelles consist of many surfactants  each  they scatter the light differently and the color of the aqueous solution will turn into bluish
at 1wt%. At .0001 wt% the color of the solution is transparent.
0	The solubility is increasing.  Also  water tension appears to be decreasing. 
0	The surface tension decreases until a critical concentration of surfactant is reached. When that critical concentration is reached  then the surfactant will start creating micelle structures which will not decrease the surface tension in at the same rate as the surfactant that is not in this configuration because the surfactant in this arrangement does not cover as much surface area as it does not in this configuration.
0	As one increases the surfactant concentration in an aqueous solution  the surface tension of the solution decreases because the surfactant interferes with the bonding within the solution.  The alignment of the surfactant creates an obstacle for the solution.

The turbidity of the solution increases as the surfactant concentration increases.  At 1 weight percent  the solution will be very foggy compared to the much more transparent solution at 0.001 weight percent surfactant.
0	With the addition of surfactants  they form small aggregates of molecules to form micelles  which reduce the surface tension of the liquid.
From a certain concentration of micelles - the critical micelle concentration - no longer occurs the formation of such structures  which stabilizes the decrease.
0	Hydrophilic parts of surfactants are forming bonds with water (electrostatic interaction) and hydrophobic parts form bonds with air (Van der Waals interaction)  so surface tension becomes smaller and smaller. At critical micelle concentration surface tension stops declining  because surfactants tend to form micelles inside   the liquid.

Surface tension at 0.001 weight percent is bigger (50) than at 1 percent (35) due to lack of surfactants.
0	The ability of low concentrations of surfactants to spread out and increase surface tension decreases with higher surfactant concentrations.  At the critical micelle concentration (0.12 wt%)aggregation occurs which no longer allows for surface tension declines.  Micelles form because once there is sufficient surfactant concentration the surface energy is negative.  The appearance of the 0.001 wt % solution will be transparent as little light is reflected; however at 1 wt micelles have formed and a blueish light is reflected and the solution appears cloudy. 
0	Surfactants lower surface tension to a certain point and then start forming micelles.  When this occurs you begin to see nanometer sized particles that cloud the water and begin to give it a bluish tint
0	Below about .02 wt%  the surfactant molecules are filling up the surface of the liquid  lowering its surface tension.  After about .02wt%  the surfactant molecules begin to form micelles in the bulk of the solution rather than populating the surface  and so have little effect on surface tension.  At .001 wt% there will be no micelles to scatter light  so the liquid will appear clear.  At 1 wt %  there will be micelles to scatter light and the solution will appear cloudy.
0	At the crossing point  the concentration of the surfactant molecule is sufficient that it aggregates into a structure such as a liposome or a micelle.  At this point  the impact on surface tension becomes markedly less.
0	When surfactant molecules are first introduced into water  it lowers the surface tension of the water until it reaches a critical point at around 0.02 wt%. After that point  the surfactant molecules start aggregating into micelles. Additional surfactant molecules no longer lower the surface tension and therefore the surface tension remains almost a constant. At 0.001 wt%  the water is clear. At 1% wt%  the water is turbid because the micelles formed interact with light.
0	At low concentrations  as the concentration of the surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. At concentrations above about 0.02% the solution surface becomes saturated with surfactant  and the surfactant will start to aggregate. At higher concentrations the solution will become cloudy as more surfactant is occurring as aggregations within the solution. 
0	As the surfactant molecules reach a critical concentration at about 0.02%  they start to aggregate and exclude water  forming structures with their hydrophobic ends pointed towards the centre  and their hydrophilic ends at the surface in contact with water. This reduces the potential energy of the repulsion between the polar water molecules and the non-polar hydrophobic ends of the surfactant. The aggregations of surfactant molecules are large enough to scatter light  particularly at the blue end of the visible spectrum. 
0	As you add more of the surfactant  the surface tension gets lowered. The surfactant molecules position themselves at the surface of the water with the hydrophilic part sticking into the water  and the hydrophobic part sticking into the air. This process lowers the surface tension. And some point  enough surfactant is added for micelles and similar aggregates to form. That means  instead of going to the surface  the molecules form aggregates (e.g. small "balls" within the solution with the hydrophilic parts forming the interface with the water) and the solution becomes cloudy. At this point  the surface tension does not change anymore  or at least not very rapidly. 
The solution at 0.0001 weight percent is clear  with a thin oily film at the surface.  At 1 percent  however  the solution is very cloudy and whiteish.
0	As the concentration grows it reaches the CMC and the molecules arrange themselves in spherical micelles. The spherical arrangement is the toughest to be squeezed under pressure  thus we observe a big grow in the internal tension. At 0.0001 it will be a clear solved solution. At 1 it will became cloggy and we will be able to see small droplets no the surface or even a homogenous layer. 
0	as the quatity of surfact increase  the molecules to which the surfactant is attach is covered by the surfactant molecules until is completely covered... where the surface tension maintains constant
0	As the amount of surfactant goes up  the surface tension goes down rapidly  until it forms a micelle and only slightly decreases.  The reason for this is because the two ends of the surfactant (the hydrophobic side and the hydrophillic side) physically break the bonds of that create surface tension.  At .0001 the solution would be fairly clear  and at 1 the solution would become milky.
0	At low concentration the number of polar group inside the water per area is gradually increased. Therefore the surface tension decreased. At higher surfactant concentration the surfactant pass the critical point after which it creates micelles that don't affect the surface tension.
0	In solution during increasing concentration of surfactant at some point (in shown diagramm at approximately .011 wt%) concentration of surfactant is anought to create micelles. So that point matches MC. 
Below that point solution will be bluish (because of scattering) 
Above this point solution will be turbid (because of micelles) 
0	Surfactants are substances used to reduce the surface tension of water and thus helping to remove non polar dust particles from the substrate to be cleaned. Surfactants contain one hydrophilic end which dissolves in water and a hydrophobic end which dissolves the non-polar molecules. 

As surfactants are used to lower the surface tension  it is found that with increase in amount of the surfactants  the surface tension decreases. This is depicted in the graph as a line which is going down according to the increase in concentration. It is also observed that after a particular point the graph remains unchanged and is parallel to the x axis. At this point  the surfactant molecule together with water and non-polar molecules aggregates spontaneously to form micelles and this concentration is called Critical Micelles Concentration. From this point there is no change in surface tension with addition of surfactants. 

Even though we change the concentration scale from .001 to 1 percentage weight  the shape of the graph will be the same. But the line will be starting form a lower value of surface tension  but the plateau will start appearing form the same concentration  being the CMC is unchanged. So the shape of the graph will be almost same as the original plot  but the line starts from a surface tension value below 50.

0	The micelle critical point appear to be at around 0.015wt%
Below that concentration  the surfactant are dissolving in water
(or at least the polar end it - the hyrophobic end sticks out of
the water). Above the micelle critical concentration  the surfactants
spontaneously aggregate to form structures. The nature of these 
structures depends on characteristics of the surfactant - head size 
tail volume  and tail length.
At 1%weight  the solution will look bluish  as the micelles act to
scatter light.
0	Initially  as the concentration of surfactant increases  we see a decrease in surface tension.  Once we hit the critical micelle concentration  however  micelle formation begins and the surface tension changes only very little from that point on with increasing surfactant addition.  These micelles form and increase the turbidity of the solution  so that with higher concentrations of surfactant the solution takes on a translucent bluish appearance.
0	From the graph  as the weight percent surfactant increases  surface tension of the fluid decreases.  This is the result of decreased hydrogen bonding due to micelles formation.  At about 0.01-0.02 wt%  critical micelle concentration is reached  and additional surfactants does not further reduce the surface tension but instead go into the existing micelles.  This is why the surface tension of the liquid no longer decreases past the CMC.  Typically  more micelles concentrated solution is more bluish.
0	The surface tension is dropping as the surfactant is added. At certain point  the surface tension doesn't change anymore  as the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached and molecules are starting to aggregate into micelles.
The solution at 0.001 weight percent will be clear/transparent  and at 1 weight percent it will be bluish in color (because of presence of micelles and their ability to scatter light).
0	In the first stage of the graph  the surface tension decreases because the action of the surfactant. The molecules start to order with his hydrophilic head oriented into the water. But suddenly  in certain concentration (wt around 0.02)  the amount of the molecules is so high  that they start to packed in micelles  so the capacity to decrease the surface tension is nearly null.
The apareance of the sollution will be nearly water at the first  but it will be like a smooth no transparent fluid at 1 weight
0	The change in the slope of the plot indicates that the CMC is reached  so no more surfactant goes to the surface  but it starts to form micelles.

When this occur  at 1% for example  the solution turns slightly bluish and turbid.
0	Before the critical point surfactants low the surface tension? it looks like usual solution. so it`s 0.001 point.
But then in a crytical point  the surface tension doesn't change anymore. And what's happening there is a very unusual thing. These molecules have decided to join one another  aggregate spontaneously
to create these things called micelles.
Once we get above this critical micelle concentration - in 1 % point we start to see these nanometer scale particles that scatter light. And it gets a little bluish tinge because of the way light scatters at
different wavelengths. And these can form aggregates  all kinds of complexity these surfactants.
0	The surfacants will start to lower the surface tension of the solution. Once the critical micelle concentration CMC  is reached  the formation of micelle occurs by aggregation of the surfacants molecules. The surface tension remains constant from that point on.
