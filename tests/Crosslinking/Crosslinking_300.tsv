0	Butadiene  the monomeric unit of polybutadine contains two double bonds.  A reaction (such as an addition) can occur at one of these double bonds.  If this happens many times a polymer will form.  There will still be many double bonds present where reactions can occur cross-linking these units together.  In polyethylene there is only one double bond between two carbons.  Once the polymer is formed the -H2C-CH2- unit is repeated leaving no place for cross-linking to occur.
0	I think polyethylene would not be cross linked because the monomer of polyethylene is ethylene/ethene  and it only has one site for reaction  just one double bond and it is linear  so even if something were added it would keep the chain linear. Unlike polyethylene  the monomer for polybutadiene  1 3-Butadiene   has two double bonds. Due to this  there are two sites where other monomers can join  as well other compounds. For example  when Butadiene is used to make tire rubber  sulphur is used for crosslinking  the sulphur can add at one monomer site on one chain of polybutadiene and link it to another.
0	Polybutadiene has a carbon-carbon double bond which can be broken to accommodate an anionic inhibitor to initiate anionic polymerization  allowing it to form cross-links. In the case of polyethylene  there is no carbon-carbon double bond within the repeating unit of ethylene itself  thus preventing anionic polymerization from taking place. 
0	it's not a straight chain length polymeriazation reaction  the free Carbon atom keeps reacting on
0	Polybutadiene has a double bond  due to which it can form a cross-linked polymer. 
Polyethylene hasn't this double bond. Hence it can't be cross-linked.
0	Polybutadiene retains a double C=C bond after polymerization allowing a radical to attach and radicalize a part of the polymer opening it up to crosslinking.  Polyethylene has only single bonds leaving no place but the ends of the chain for radical activity.
0	There's a double bond available for nucleophilic (base) attack on butadiene  whereas polymer for polyethylene is repeat of saturated system -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R.
0	ethylene has only one double bond so it can't be cross-linked. butadiene has two conjugated double bonds (1-2 addition and 1-4 addition).  more possible places for it to react than ethylene.
0	because it has larger chain
0	Because the structure in polybutadiene is displaced
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because the butadiene mer has a kinked backbone of C atoms with every other bond being a double bond. The double bond can be broken by use of heat and a catalyst and allows a new bond to be formed creating cross linking. The reaction is endothermic. 

Polyethylene cannot be cross linked because it is formed of long chains of Carbon connected by the double bonded Carbons in CH2 CH2. The reaction is exothermic so it produces a lot of heat. The long chains can be linear or branched but they are terminated by two CH3 groups so they will not cross-link. 
0	The polybutadiene is a polymer  trifuncional  have three covalent bonds and can from 3D networks  in change  the polyetilene is a polymer linear formed by bifunctional monomer units.
0	the structure of butadiene is CH2=CH-CH=CH2. when we write  polybutadiene it turns to be: -[CH2-CH=CH-CH2]-. so this double bond can be opened and we`ll have two more bonds  whis is not yet involved in making polymer. the bonds can be a key for polybutadien to be a cross-linked polymer. 
but when we write  polyethylene -[CH2-CH2]- all carbons have already have 4 ''neighbours''  so we have no place to add smth else to make polyethylene being a cross-linked polymer.
0	Polybutadiene has more carbons  which can give a variety of ways of connections between each other.
0	Butadiene (polybutadiene's monomer) has two double bonds  which allow two possible places places to react with it. And every time a butadiene is linked  there are more places to react  forming a cross-linked polymer.
However  ethylene only has one double bond and it forms a linear polymer  without crossings. 
0	polybutadiene can be crosslinked because of its double bonds. Polyethylene cannot be crosslinked because each c-atom is sp3 hybridized ad tetrahedral.
0	
0	in polybutadiene the monomer has two double bonds and both in different planes so its polymer can be cross-linked but in case of polyethylene there is a tripple bond and planar  structure so it does not forms cross-linkages. 
0	Because polybutadiene is produced by anionic procedures and polyethylene by addition procedures
0	For polyethylene  the repeating unit has only one place for the extra linking electron to go  at its end.  This results in a linear structure with no cross-links.

Polybutadiene  in contrast  involves a longer repeating unit which has two locations for an extra linking electron.  One location is at the end  and the other is in the middle.  As a result  the resulting polymer can be cross-linked with structures originating from the middle of an isomeric unit.
0	Because of the position of the carbon atoms relative to the hydrogen atoms in polybutadiene the carbon atom is exposed and is thus susceptible to ionic reaction. In the case of polyethylene the low angle mixed with a shielding effect from the surrounding hydrogen atoms prevents this from happening.
0	Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds with other molicules. But in the case of polyethylene this property is missing. 
0	In the case of Polybutadiene(PB)  the structure of the monomer repeating unit ie. Butadiene is branched and the crosslinking can be carried out easily compared to PolyEthylene(PE) since PE has a linear structure.

P.S. I cant totally agree to the statement that PE cannot be cross-linked.
PE may be of different types. A High Density PE has a Linear Structure whereas a low density PE or LDPE has a branched structure  thus making it easier to crosslink. 
0	The carbon polymers  such as polyethylene  consist of C-C bonds along the backbone. The C-C bond length is small: about 1.54 angstroms  and there is not enough room for a radical to replace one of the methyl groups along the sides of the backbone.

The polybutadiene polymer consists of siloxane  or Si-O-Si bonds along the backbone. The distance between the silicon atoms is twice the Si-O bond length  or much greater than the C-C bond length  so now there is room for a methyl group to be replaced by a radical that can form crosslinks between two polymer chains.
0	A polymer cannot form any cross-links when the repeating unit can bond to no more than two other units  as in the case of polyethylene  where the chain reaction breaks the double bond between the two carbons in ethylene  allowing it to bond to a repeating unit and inducing the reaction in another ethylene molecule. The result is a chain without any cross-links.

However  the repeating unit in polybutadiene has a double bond between the central carbon atoms. This allows the ends of two polybutadiene chains to react with the central carbons  break one of the bonds and form links within the repeating unit.
0	polybutadiene  has double bonds C-C that are available to react with another radicals. On the contrary polyethylene can no react as long as it has no more C-C double bonds.
0	Cross-linking requires that the chain reaction can proceed from multiple ends after a carbon double bond has been broken. Polybutadiene with its CH2 group can provide these multiple ends. Polyethylene however with its CH group only provides a single end from where the chain reaction can proceed. The chain reaction on polyethylene is thus restricted to linear development  and no cross-links can form.
0	Cross-links are possible only if a polymer unit (a monomer molecule) has more than one double bonding. Additional bondings allow the molecule to be a part of more than one polymer chains which is the esssence of cross-links. Ethylene has only one double bonding  so it can't be cross-linked.
0	Polybutadiene has a doble bond in its monomer wich can desolve a make two new bonds with other mononmer... 
0	The polybutadiene has two centers where it can build chains with other radicals or starters .
So it build a crosslinked polymer 
0	Polybutadiene can be crosslinked because of its double bonds. Polyethylene cannot be crosslinked because each c-atom is sp3 hybridized and tetrahedral.
0	Ethylene  C2H2C2H2 has only two sides  so the only polymerization possible when breaking the double bond will be linear
Butadiene can have a double bond located in different places  which will create more options for crosslinking
0	in polybutadiene  there is more double bonds
0	If you want a polymer to be cross-linked  the units have to be polar or at least there should be a functional group that attracts electron from a carbon which the group is binded with. Ethylene is symmetrical molecule only with two carbons connected with double bond and four hydrogens connected to carbons. On the other hand  when we look at one carbon in butadiene we can see that it is connected to at least one group containing double bond which has bigger potential to attract an electron. And as the cross-linking is related to anionic polymerization  this cannot occur in case of non-polar ethylene.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double bond  which can react to form a cross-linked polymer. However  polyethylene has not this double bond. Therefore it can not be cross-linked.
0	*For a material to be a cross linked polymer it should essentially have an electron withdrawing group       attached to the double bond .
*Ethylene don't have an electron withdrawing group attached to its double bonded carbon.
*In butadiene  one of the double bond act as the electron withdrawing group and hence it fulfills the essential requirement

0	Polybutadiene has double bonds and has no double bonds
0	poliethylene has only one single pond  only one reactive site  so it can only form fonds in one way producind linear polimers. polyenes  however can have more than one reactive site and can react in different sites and even with itself producing cross linked polimers
0	double bonds
0	Repeating units of polybutadiene contain two double bonds. One of them is for 	
formation crosslinks and other for linear link.
Repeating units of polyethylene contain only one doble bond that forms linear links.
0	Polyethylene does not cross link because it has no double bonds between carbons so the polymer chain has only one arrangement of the atoms.  Polybutadiene has double bonded carbons that can break and reform in different arrangements which allows for the molecules to cross link.
0	the symmetry of polyethylene allow for it to be linked in any orientation and remain the same in effect. while polybutadiene only has 1 way symmetry  meaning if it is placed in a different orientation  e.g. top down vs bottom up  will make it effectively different. 
0	The polybutadiene repeat unit hold a double bond which can be broken to a single bond and two isolated electrons  each one at the 2 middle carbons. These electrons can form a single bond with another butadiene repeat unit. So this unit forms a cross with can expand in 4 directions and form a net.
A polyethylene unit doesnt have a double bond. So it can only expand lineary - there is no possibility to form a cross point.

The formation of cross-links requires that the repeating unit have more than one carbon-carbon double bond. In the case of polybutadiene  the repeating unit has an extra double bond. Hence  there is a possibility for growing/continuing the chain using that double bond as a site for the addition of the next repeating unit. However  in the case of polyethylene  there is no other double bond in the repeating unit  from where another chain can be formed. Therefore  polybutadiene can be cross-linked but polyethylene cannot.
0	1 3 butadiene is CH2=CH-CH=CH2 and when it polymerised can give Polybutadiene on the form of trans 1 4 addition   1 2 addition and even cis 1 4 addition. The last addition the double bond makes bend of the chain. In the 1 2 addition  the double bond in branch allows cross-linking. 
0	The polyethylene structure does not have the methyl groups that offer the cross-linking opportunity seen in the polybutadiene structure.

This a classic example of condensation polymerization  I know that we will be removing 1 water and splicing the two molecules together. However  since we are talking about the overall repeat unit  we also have to take 1 extra H off the first substance and 1 extra -OH group off the 2nd substance. Thus Polymer like polyethylene cannot be cross linked whereas polybutadiene can be cross-linked
0	Polybutadiene can be cross linked because it has carbon-carbon double bonds that can be activated to form more links.

cross-linking requires covalent bonds.
0	Ethylene has only one double bond & can (essentially) only polymerise linearly.  The radical generated on the end of the molecule interacts with the double bond on another monomer unit to generate a further radical & the reaction propagates.
Butadiene has two double bonds.  There are  conceivably  two polymerisation mechanisms.
The radical can propagate from C1 through C2 and onto another butadiene monomer molecule  thus leaving a pendant ethylenic grouping: -(CH2-CH (CH=CH2)-CH2-CH...) etc.  This unsaturated side chain can then  be considered as a new monomer unit  which can form a branched structure when it contacts another growing radical.  This ultimately would lead to cross-linking via the propagation or combination termination of the branches.
Alternatively  and more likely: Butadiene has conjugated double bonds & the radical flow can occur through C1 to C4  thus leaving a new double bond between C2 & C3: -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-)n- .  Here a new double bond has also been generated  which can form branches & crosslinks in a similar manner as before.  For the 1 4-polymerisation cis- & trans- forms of  polymer (polymer segments) are possible.
0	Because polybutadiene has two double bonds in its structure and because of that it can be linked in the beggining as well as in the end of the polymer.
0	Etylene has only one double bond which is used up during the polymerization  meaning repeat units can only be added to the end of a long chain 
Butadiene also builds up a chain like etylene  however there is still another double bond left in the repeat unit after reaction  which can react again with a repeat unit at a later point in time to give a side-arm to the polymere chain. This side-arm can then also continue to grow  arc more  etc. etc.
0	Butadiene contains two Carbon to Carbon double bonds. This provides each molecule with four sites for (polymerisation) attaching to other molecules. The molecules can therefor polymerise across as well as along their length.

Ethene has only one Carbon to Carbon double bond and can therefore attach to two other molecules (compared to four for Butadiene). No cross linking is therefore possible on polyethylene.
0	The presence of the carbon-carbon double bond in the repeating unit of polybutadiene allows carbons from two different polymer chains to form a crosslinking bond when that double-bond is broken.

The saturated structure of polyethylene means that the formation of these crosslinks is impossible (unless  perhaps  the substance is imparted sufficient energy to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds).
0	Polyethene does not contain any more double bonds which could react in an addition polymerisation section. In fact all carbons atoms are fully saturated and C-C single (and C-H) bonds are hard to break. 
Polybutadiene however contains a double bond between the two central carbons in each repeat unit. The pi-bond will break more easily and can undergo further addition polymerisation reaction between individual strands of the polymer  thus cross-linking it.
0	Butadiene has two double bonds( At the terminals) which after the polymerization of the terminal carbons get shifted to the center( as shown in S27E1) these double bonds account for the cross linking whereas the terminal carbons involve in the linear chain extension. In Ethene  we have only a Single double bond which gets utilized in the linear polymerization and there are none for crosslinking.
0	Polybutadiene has double bonds which is available to other ligants to form cross-links. On the other hand  in polyethyleno there are not such double bonds
0	From the procedure of polymerizing ethene we can see that polyethylene can be  a  line of CH_2 (lines ending with CH_3) without any double bond at all.  On the other hand polybutadiene has one double bond on each unit which is repeated to create a polymer molecule. So  the active base (initiator) during the polymerization of butadiene can 'attack' a growing chain of polybutadiene at any double bond in it creating cross-links.
A polyethylene can be only a line of ethene units.

Monomers that offer one bond site can only polymerize to create linear polymers.  

Monomers that have two or more active bond sites can polymerize to create branching molecules that also close loop and bond back on themselves.
0	Double-bonds allow for cross-linking.
0	Cross-linking is possible  if there already are polymolecules (with the lower polymerisation grade) and some reactant  which can cross connect them.  
Polyethylene grows its molecules by addition from the monomere. It is initialised  than it can run for a very long molecules and than it is stopped by some stoping condition. If we putted some cross-linking reactant into the polymerization reactor  it would take effect of the terminator of the polymerization.
0	In order to cross-link  the monomer of the polimers has to have at least two double bonds because in addition to a double bond that creates bonding among monomers  another double bond is required to form bonds that cross-link the monomers.
In case of polybutadiene  two double bonds exist in each monomer  while for polyethylene only one double bond can be found in each monomer.
0	For a polymer to be able to be cross-linked  there must be a carbon-carbon double bond in the repeat unit  so that the cross-linking agent may break that bond to link itself to it. While there remains a carbon-carbon double bond in a repeat unit in polybutadiene  such double bonds are lost in polyethylene in the process of polymerization. 
0	We need different places to connect
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-inked unlike polyethlene because of its conformational structure. The cross-linkages allow for less steric hindrance in polybutadiene in comparison to the polyethylene. 
0	The polybutadiene monomer consists of  double bonded carbons with a CH2 and H group attached to each of the double bonded carbons.  The polyethylene monomer consists also of double bonded carbons; however  all of the double bonded carbons are attached to only H atoms.  The polybutadiene has steroisomerism with restricted rotation that when reacted with a crosslinking agent can switch forms from cis to trans.  This type of reaction is not possible with the structure of polyethylene.
0	Due to double bond carbon in polybutadiene structure it is possible for the molecule to have cross-link  where  the polyethylene has'n any available electrons for cross-linking.  
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked due to the presence of double bond between central carbon atoms. It allows to form additional free electron during reaction with initiator. What allows for the formation of cross-links is the more than one possible way of forming a product  like in S27V3 there were 3 possible connections. 
0	In order to support cross-linking  it must be possible for the polymer chain to be branched (so that there are places for the cross-links to anchor).  In carbon-based chains such as polyethylene and polybutadiene  this requires the presence of a double-bond somewhere in the repeating unit that can be opened up to provide two single bonds - one to support the continued presence of a polymer chain  and the other to join with the cross-linking unit(s).   Polybutadiene possesses such a double bond  and can therefore be cross-linked  but polyethylene does not.  In polyethylene  the original double-bond in the ethylene monomer is fully used up in forming the original polymer chain.
0	From the procedure of polymerizing ethene we can see that polyethylene can be  a  line of CH_2 (lines ending with CH_3) without any double bond at all.  On the other hand polybutadiene has one double bond on each unit which is repeated to create a polymer molecule. So  the active base (initiator) during the polymerization of butadiene can 'attack' a growing chain of polybutadiene at any double bond in it creatinf cross-links.
A polyethylene can be only a line of ethene units.
0	Polyethylene polymer consists of -CH2-CH2- cycles  which are saturated and there are no reaction centers in the middle of cycle and due to that cross-linkers don't easily bond with polyethylene.
Polybutadiene polymer consist of -CH2-CH=CH-CH2- cycles which aren't saturated and due to this they have reaction centers where cross-linkers can easily bond with polybutadiene
0	There are still some double bonds between carbons left in polybutadiene polymer  so it have an option to brake the bond and react with another branch of itself. In the same time  there's no more double bonds left in the polyethylene polymer.
0	Ethylene has only one double bond (CH2=CH2). When molecules of ethylene form polyethylene  there is no more double bond (-CH-CH-).
Butadiene has 2 double bond (CH2=CH-CH=CH2). When it forms polybutadiene  there is still one double bond (-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-). So this double bond allows formation of cross-link.
0	As butadiene has double bonds in each one of its monomers  it can create bounds to elastomers  differntly of polyethilene  which only has simple bonds.
0	The polybutadiene has two centers where it can build chains with other radicals or starters 
0	Enter essay here. I found nothing in the course material to explain this. I'm guessing its because  butadiene has 2 c-c double bonds so they can be broken differently and somehow form side chains that can link across to other side chains. That's the best I can offer from the course material. This was not covered very clearly.
0	Because polybutadiene has two methyl groups and isn't as linear as polyethylene.
0	Polybutadiene exists because the no of radical carbon that can be formed is more than one such that attack can occur on both and a cross link is formed unlike in poly ehylene whre the radical carbon is only one.
0	it has a branched double bond for electrophilic attack on double bond but polyethylene has only one functional group for polymerisation on each molecule
0	Polybutadiene has two double bonds so this means it has 2 sites where it can react with the crosslinker  where as the ethene has only one site.
0	Polyethylene has only single bonds  polybutadiene has a double bond where it can form cross-links
0	polyethylene has only 2 carbon atoms which on polymerization are linked to one another to form a chain of molecules. However in polybutadiene  polymerization takes place with the attached CH2 group to facilitate its linking. hence it can be crosslinked while polyethene cannot.
0	When polymer chains are linked together by crosslinks they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer where the chains are freely flowing can be turned into a solid or gel by crosslinking the chains together.

In polymer chemistry  when a synthetic polymer is said to be crosslinked  it usually means that the entire bulk of the polymer has been exposed to the crosslinking method. The resulting modification of mechanical properties depends strongly on the crosslink density. Low crosslink densities decrease the viscocities of polymer melts. Intermediate crosslink densities transform gummy polymers into materials that have elastometric properties and potentially high strengths. Very high crosslink densities can cause materials to become very rigid or glassy  such as phenol-formaldehyde materials

Crosslinks can be formed by chemical reactions that are initiated by heat  pressure  change in pH  or radiation.  Mixing of an unpolymerized or partially polymerized resin with specific chemicals called crosslinking reagents results in a chemical reaction that forms crosslinks. Crosslinking can also be induced in materials that are normally thermoplastic through exposure to a radiation source  such as electron beam exposure  gamma-radiation  or UV light.  Electron beam processing is used to crosslink the C type of crosslinked polyethylene. Other types of crosslinked polyethylene are made by addition of peroxide during extruding (type A) or by addition of a crosslinking agent vinylsilane and a catalyst during extruding and then performing a post extrusion curing.

The chemical process of vulcanization is a type of crosslinking and it changes the property of rubber to the hard  durable material we associate with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing  and the term vulcanization comes from Vulcan  the Roman god of fire. However  this is a slow process taking around 8 hours. A typical car tire is cured for 15 minutes at 150C. However  the time can be reduced by the addition of accelerators such as 2-benzothiazolethiol or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. Both of these contain a sulfur atom in the molecule that initiates the reaction of the sulfur chains with the rubber. Accelerators increase the rate of cure by catalysing the addition of sulfur chains to the rubber molecules.



Crosslinks are the characteristic property of thermosetting plastic materials. In most cases  crosslinking is irreversible  and the resulting thermosetting material will degrade or burn if heated  without melting. Especially in the case of commercially used plastics  once a substance is crosslinked  the product is very hard or impossible to recycle. In some cases  though  if the crosslink bonds are sufficiently different  chemically  from the bonds forming the polymers  the process can be reversed. Permanent wave solutions  for example  break and reform naturally occurring crosslinks disulfide bonds between protein chains in hair.

Physical cross-links
Chemical covalent crosslinks are stable mechanically and thermally  so once formed are difficult to break. Therefore  crosslinked products like car tires cannot be recycled easily. A class of polymers known as thermoplastic elastomers rely on physical crosslinks in their microstructure to achieve stability  and are widely used in nontire applications  such as snowmobile tracks  and catheters for medical use. They offer a much wider range of properties than conventional crosslinked elastomers because the domains that act as crosslinks are reversible  so can be reformed by heat. The stabilising domains may be noncrystalline as in styrene-butadiene block copolymers or crystalline as in thermoplastic copolyesters.

Oxidative cross-links
Many polymers undergo oxidative crosslinking  typically when exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In some cases this is undesirable and thus polymerization reactions may involve the use of an antioxidant to slow the formation of oxidative crosslinks. In other cases  when formation of crosslinks by oxidation is desirable  an oxidizer such as hydrogen peroxide may be used to speed up the process.

The aforementioned process of applying a permanent wave to hair is one example of oxidative crosslinking. In that process the disulfide bonds are reduced  typically using a mercaptan such as ammonium thioglycolate. Following this  the hair is curled and then neutralized. The neutralizer is typically a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide  which causes new disulfide bonds to form under conditions of oxidation  thus permanently fixing the hair into its new configuration.

The drawbacks of crooslinked Polyethylene are that the process is expensive and also degradation from sunlight. PEX tubing cannot be used in applications exposed to sunlight  as it degrades fairly rapidly. Prior to installation it must be stored away from sunlight  and needs to be shielded from daylight after installation. Leaving it exposed to direct sunlight for as little as 30 days may result in premature failure of the tubing due to embrittlement.

Problems with yellow brass fittings. There have been some claimed PEX systems failures in the U.S.  Canada and Europe resulting in several pending class action lawsuits. The failures are claimed to be a result of the brass fittings used in the PEX system. Generally builders and manufacturers have learned from these experiences and have found the best materials for use in fittings used to connect pipe with connectors  valves and other fittings. But there were problems reported with a specific type of brass fitting used in connection with installations in Nevada which caused a negative interaction between its mineral-rich hard water and so-called "yellow brass" fittings. Zinc in the fittings leached into the pipe material in a chemical reaction known as dezincification  causing some leaks or blockages. A solution was to replace the yellow brass fittings which had 30% zinc with red brass fittings which had 5% to 10% zinc It led California building authorities to insist on fittings made from "red brass" which typically has a lower zinc content  and is unlikely to cause problems in the future since problems with these specific fittings have become known.

Initial adjustment to a new plumbing system. There were a few reported problems in the early stages as plumbers and homeowners learned to adjust to the new fittings  and when connections were poorly or improperly made  but home inspectors have generally not noticed any problems with PEX since 2000.

Can't use adhesives for pipe insulation. One source suggested that pipe insulation  applied to PEX using certain adhesives  could have a detrimental effect causing the pipe to age prematurely; however  other insulating materials can be used such as conventional foam wrap insulation without negative effects.

Fittings somewhat more expensive. Generally PEX fittings  particularly the do-it-yourself compression ones  are more expensive than copper ones  although there is no soldering required. Due the flexibility of PEX  it generally requires fewer fittings  which tends to offset the higher cost per fitting.

Potential problems for PEX radiant heating with iron-based components. If PEX tubing is used in a radiant heating system which has ferrous radiators or other parts  meaning they are made out of iron or its alloys  then there is the possibility of rust developing over time; if this is the case  then one solution is to have an "oxygen barrier" in these systems to prevent rust from developing. However  in new installations PEX pipes and iron-based components are not intermixed.

Possible health effects. There was controversy in California during the 2000s about health concerns. Several groups blocked adoption of PEX for concerns about chemicals getting into the water  either from chemicals outside the pipes  or from chemicals inside the pipes such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and tertiary butyl alcohol. These concerns delayed statewide adoption of PEX for almost a decade. After substantial back-and-forth legal wrangling which was described as a judicial rollercoaster  the disputing groups came to a consensus  and California permitted use of PEX in all occupancies. An environmental impact report and subsequent studies determined there were no causes for concerns about public health from use of PEX piping.

Polybutadiene seems to adapt for a wider range of uses compared to Polyethylene due to it's ability to allow for strengthening by chemical change (cross-linking)

0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because its covalent double C bonds allow Carbons to link together between polybutadiene chains. On the other hand  polyethylene has no such bonds in its monomers available to cross-linking between chains.
0	In order to have cross-linking  the monomer has to have at least three locations where it can bond to another monomer. Ethene only has two such locations  while butadiene  in principle  has four such locations. This is because butadiene has two double bonds  each of which allow two monomers to be added.
0	It is a polybutadiene is termoset and has covalent bonds  and polyethylene has ionic bonds. 
0	Polyethylene has only one double bond  so it can connect to only 2 groups  and can only create a chain. But polybutadiene has two double bonds and can connect to 4 groups  so it can cross-link with other chains.
0	Polyethylene's structures does not allow for cross linking because it is very linear in structure. The polymer can grow on either ends and does not leave double bonds for the repeating units to form cross-links with. Polybutadiene on the other hand does allow for cross-lining because of the double-bond which remains with each of the repeating units.

0	Polybutadiene is a a polymer made from a monomer that contains two carbon-carbon double bonds  this means that a Polybutadiene monomer can bond with two other Polybutadiene monomers thus is creating a net of Polybutadiene monomers  a cross-linked polymer. On the other hand  polyethylene is a a polymer made from a monomer that contains a single carbon-carbon double bond  so a polyethylene monomer can bond only with one polyethylene monomer  creating a chain.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double bond that can be used to be attached to the chain of the cross-limking agent. 
Polyethylene on the other side  does not have a way to bond to any other thing.
0	This is the answer.
0	 polybutadiene contains double bonds which will help in cross linking. but in polyethene does not have such facilities (double bonds) . 
0	because polybutadiene has another substance added to it that "glues together" all the ends there for making it cross-linked.
0	Because ethylene has only one double carbon-carbon bond. In contrast  butadiene has two double carbon-carbon bonds. So one of them is used to form the link between monomers and the other to create CROSS LINKS
0	Crosslinking requires 
0	Polybutadiene in his monomer unit have double bond which allow him to be cross-linked to another polybutadiene by interaction of p bonds while polythyene in his structure have only single bonded carbon  so it could not be cross-linked.
0	The polybutadiene can be cross-linked because the chains are linked together extensively by covalent bonds  while the polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because the chemical structure can't permit it.
0	Crosslinking is a process of linking one polymer chain to another polymer chain. Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because butadienes have conjugated diene (two carbon-carbon double bonds). As the butadienes polymerized in a straight chain by trans or cis double bond  there are some double bond branches left over as a result of 1 2- addition polymerization. The double bonds in the branches allow the cross linking to happen by linking to another polybutadiene chain. 

However  polyethylene does not have such double bonds to allow cross linking to occur. Addition reaction cannot be performed. 
0	A polymer in order to be cross-linked need to be able to branch.  Polyethylene has only one double bond and thus has only one way to attach the additional "mer". The resulting structure is a linear chain.
Butadiene on the other hand has 2 double bonds. if both these bonds are used to attach the next "mer" a branch is created this way  resulting in a cross-linked structure.
0	Because the polybutadiene is a compound found in three ways (cis  trans vinyl) can form cross-links such as glass  whereas the polyethylene is a linear polymer chain simple and does not allow branches or crosslinks
0	Polybutadiene has two double bonds in the repeat unit (CH2=CH-CH=CH2)  as one of them is reduced to a single bond to form the chain during polymerization  the other is available to cross-link to another chain.

Polyethylene  on the other hand  has only one doube bond in the repeat unit (CH2=CH2)  so there is nothing left to cross-link once after polimerization.

they are three types of solid polymers: elastomers  thermoplastic polymers  and
thermosetting polymers. Elastomers are rubbers or rubberlike elastic materials.
Thermoplastic polymers are hard at room temperature  but on heating become
soft and more or less fluid and can be molded. Thermosetting polymers can
be molded at room temperature or above  but when heated more strongly
become hard and infusible. These categories overlap considerably but are
nonetheless helpful in defining general areas of utility and types of structures.
The structural characteristics that are most important to determining
the properties of polymers are: (1) the degree of rigidity of the polymer molecules 
(2) the electrostatic and van der Waals attractive forces between the
chains  (3) the degree to which the chains tend to form crystalline domains 
and (4) the degree of cross-linking between the chains. 
Consider a polymer made of a tangle of molecules with long linear
chains of atoms. If the intermolecular forces between the chains are small and
the material is subjected to pressure  the molecules will tend to move past one
another in what is called plastic flow. Such a polymer usually is soluble in
solvents that will dissolve short-chain molecules with chemical structures
similar to those of the polymer. If the intermolecular forces between the chains
are sufficiently strong to prevent motion of the molecules past one another the
polymer will be solid at room temperature  but will usually lose strength and
undergo plastic flow when heated. Such a polymer is thermoplastic. A crosslink
is a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Crosslinks
are extremely important in determining physical properties because they
increase the molecular weight and limit the translational motions of the chains
with respect to one another. Only two cross-links per polymer chain are required
to connect all the polymer molecules in a given sample to produce one
gigantic molecule. Only a few cross-links  reduce greatly the
solubility of a polymer and tend to produce what is called a gel polymer  which 
although insoluble  usually will absorb  solvents in which the
uncross-linked polymer is soluble.

0	The units that are linked in polybutadiene are very weak and hence easily gets reduced so that it can be cross-linked. However the bond is quite strong in ethylene or polyethylene and hence it is not easily reduced  thus preventing cross leading.
0	I think that Polyethylene can be crosslink with the aid of an additional structure (such as the methyl triacetate silane for RTV) which has several ends to form bonds on.
Without this additional crosslinking agent  however  the polyethylene repeat unit lacks a double bond. When broken  one double bond can lead to two bonds linking the repeat unit in the structure. As Butadiene has two of them  it can be bound four times and therefore be used as a crosslinking.

0	Polybutadiene repeat unit has a double bond and a chain of four carbons that it isn't linear   then it means more links when a double bonds are breaking under different angles. Indeed  polyethylene repeat unit is linear and these doesn't allow cross-linked.
0	The polyethylene (PE) polymer is chemically more simple. It is represented by its repeating unit (CH2-CH2) n. It is one of the most common plastics  due to its high global production (approximately 60 million tons per year worldwide) and its low price. It is chemically inert. It is obtained from the polymerization of ethylene (chemical formula CH2 = CH2 and called ethene by IUPAC)  from which it derives its name.This polymer can be produced by different polymerization reactions  such as: free radical polymerization  anionic polymerization  coordination polymerization or cationic polymerization ion. Each of these reaction mechanisms produces a different type of polyethylene.Is a linear chain polymer unbranched. Although the branches are common commercial products. Polyethylene chains are arranged under the softening temperature Tg in amorphous and semicrystalline.
The molecule of butadiene  can be polymerized in three different ways  resulting in three isomers called cis  trans and vinyl. Polybutadiene properties are different according to the proportion of each of these isomers in their molecules contain. Thus  for example polybutadiene called "high-cis" has high elasticity and very appreciated as the so-called "high-trans" is a plastic crystalline without. utility application.
0	When we say the fracture of the c-c double bond  we mean the breaking of the pi bond  leaving the two carbons bonded by a single sigma bond.

The Polybutadiene monomer has two c-c double bonds  but the polyethylene monomer has only one c-c double bond.

the C-c double bond allows the monomer to enter into a polymer: as it fractures it two carbons each with a single unpaired election.  The single unpaired election allows the carbon to bond with another carbon (provided that carbon also has an unpaired election).  Hence the fracturing of the c-c double bond allows for the formation of two new bonds.  A monomer can join with two other monomers: each of those monomers can join with an additional monomer  and the polymerization can occur.

Polybutadiene has two c-c double bonds  hence it can undergo two separate polymerization processes  joining together two otherwise separate polymers.  And each monomer present can enter into polymerisation with two separate polymers: each monomer can cross link between two polymers.  Hence each polymer can be cross linked with many different polymers  and there can be a high degree of cross linking.
0	When we add initiator to ethylene  the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene breaks  and the product of that reaction is ethylene radical. If the two ethylene radicals react together  we get polyethylene as a product and the reaction stops. There is no cross-linking.
Polybutadiene  on the other hand  has TWO carbon-carbon double bonds. And when initiator is added one carbon-carbon double bond is broken to create butadiene radical that still has the second carbon-carbon double bond. And that double bond is what allows cross-linking in polybutadiene.
0	In order to create cross-linkages  monomers must be able to polymerise with more than two other monomer molecules. Alternatively a  cross-linker with the property of binding to more than two other molecules must be included. A monomer that can only link to two molecules will simply lengthen the molecule without branching.

0	Because in polyethlene there is only a double bond and a monomer can bonds with only two others monomers.
Butadiene can bonds with other  4 monomers to form polybutadiene  so can be cross-linked. 
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has double carbon bond. Theses bond can be "broken"  to a single bond  and the freed electron from the double bond can be used in a bond with somthing else. Polyethylene has no double bond  so this mechanism cannot happend
0	Polymers with double bonds can be cross linked  whereas polymers with single bonds can't.
0	Explain why a polymer such as polybutadiene can be cross-linked  however a polymer such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked.
0	A cross-link is generally when a polymer is chained(linked) to another polymer. For polymers to be cross linked it has to have a bond which can sacrifice an electron to form another bond  such as double bonds and triple bonds. Single bonds however do not have any way to sacrifice an electron to form a link. In polybutadiene the C=C bond inside the repeating unit is why it can form cross links with other polymers while in polyethylene a C-C bond exists which is unable to form any bonds(links) with another polymer due to the insufficiency of electrons to form bonds.
0	Polybutadiene has starved Carbon molecules (CH2) in its repeat unit which makes bonding of cross linker molecules easier.
Polyethylene has a more closed arrangement.
0	PolyButadiene can form crosslinks due to the presence of not one but two double bonds. Polyethylene has only one double bond so can only form one dimensional polymers.
0	The two double bonds in polybutadiene allows for another polybutadiene molecule to attach to multiple locations.  Thus creating a branch in the polymer chain.  The various branches could then connect up with other chains and cause cross-linking.  In contrast  polyethylene has no double bonds and only allows the chain to grow on the ends.  So no cross-linking occurs.
0	In polybutadiene there are two carbon atoms where radicalization is possible whereas in polyethylene only one carbon is possible.  
0	the second double-bond in the case of polybutadiene
0	Cross-linking can only occur when there are double bonded carbons.  One of the bonds gets broken and therefore is available to bond to something else.  Polybutadiene has double bonded carbons  so it can be cross-linked  and polyethylene does not have double bonded carbons  so it cannot.
0	polyethylene is very straight. polybutadiene is shaped like an x so molecules can become squished together and cross linked. 
0	In Polyethilene theres only a original double bond. As the double bond is break theres no place to bond one chain to another. In polybutadiene there are two double bonds. One acts as a chain reaction to polymerize polibutadieno. The other double bond can be break and form a bae of a bridge to another chain.

0	Butadiene has two sites to which additional units can be attached  allowing connection to existing polymers  closed loops  and interlinked structures.  Initiated ethylene can only extend from one end  permitting only unidirectional extension of the structure.
0	Polybutadiene contains a double bond in each repeat unit  which can be attacked by an anion. This anion (a so called 'cross-linker')  then effectively acts as a bridge between two different polymer strands (or another double bond in the same strand). Thus a cross-linked polymer is formed.

Polyethylene contrasts in that it has no double bond in its repeat unit  so no sites are available for a cross-linker to join.
0	Polyethylene will form a linear chain due to the molecular alignment and the tetrahedral nature of the bonds.
Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it can form bonds at multiple points in the molecule.
0	Because polybuadiene has double bonds while polyethylene doesn't.
0	The repeat units of polyethylene only contain one double bond and can therefore only form chains. 
The repeat units of polybutadiene contain two double bonds (diene) that allow cross-linking in cis  trans and vinyl connectivity. Trans bonds keep the polymer straight  whilst cis bends the polymer.
0	In the absence of external corss-linkers:

Polybutadiene has two double bonds in the repeat unit (CH2=CH-CH=CH2)  as one of them is reduced to a single bond to form the chain during polymerization  the other is available to cross-link to another chain.

Polyethylene  on the other hand  has only one doube bond in the repeat unit (CH2=CH2)  so there is nothing left to cross-link once after polimerization.
0	Polyethylenes are thermoplastic in nature and therefore they can not be reprocessed repeatedly. It however will soften and flow  and lose critical physical properties at temperature thereby limiting its applications. Therefore cross-linking of polyethylene is carried out to retain desirable properties at high temperature. Cross-linking will change the nature of polymer from thermoplastic to thermoset to yield a non-melting  more durable polymer matrix.


Butadiene is left with a second double bond when it polymerizes  making cross chains possible.
0	
In Cross-linking polymerization one polymeric chain gets connected to the other through a bond which can be covalent or ionic.  
In the case of polyethylene  the monomer ethylene molecule contains one c=c double bond which is used for the addition polymerization. Since there are no extra double bonds or branches in the polyethylene chain it cannot undergo cross-linking polymerization. 
While in the case of polybutadiene  the monomer is a conjugated diene  1 3 butadiene.  1 3-butadiene has two c=c double bonds and  even after polymerization  there exists one C=C double bond between the 2 3 carbon atoms   in each repeating unit of the polymer  which allows further polymerization leading to cross linking.  1 3-butadiene can undergo polymerization in different ways  like  1 4-addition in cis and trans forms allowing bending in the chain. The existence of the double bonds in the chain permits branching and thus to cross-linked polymers. 
Those polymeric chains which contain repeating units with branches can easily undergo cross-linking polymerization. Also the presence of double or triple bonds are also provides a good chance for the polymeric chains to get cross-linked. In addition to this the presence of functional groups in the polymeric chains can also help in cross-linking between the chains leading to the change in property of the polymer. For example a polymer in liquid state can be converted to solid through cross-linking. Soft rubber can be hardened through vulcanization. Bakalite is another good example of cross-linked polymer.

0	Maybe because polybutadiene has multible double bonds.
0	Butadiene has two double bonds and only one needs to be broken to form ploybutadiene. The polymer has carbon-carbon double bonds which can be broken and used to form cross links.

Ethylene has a single carbon-carbon double bond. Once polyethylene has been formed   via the breaking of the double bond  there are no double bonds remaining and no way to form cross-links.

0	To have a cross-linked polymer  there must remain double bonds in the polymer chain. This doesn't happen in the case of polyethylene  but it happens to polybutadiene:
 
 (- CH2 - CH2 )- n                                        (- CH2 - CH = CH - CH2 )-
 polyethylene mer                                         polybutadiene mer
0	The polybutadiene structure have more places to bond than polyethylene. The last one can only form to bonds  which are not enough to form cross-linked molecules.
0	The repeating units for polyethylene are (-CH2-CH2-) so the only one possiblility for the polymerization is adding a unit at the end. However the repeting units for the polybutadiene (-C=CH-CH=C-) has three possibilities of polymerization cis  trans and vynil.

0	First of all the polyethylene can't be  cross-linked because it hasn't a double bonding carbon. Otherwise the monomer polybutadiene can form many bonds with other monomers  breaking the carbon double bonding.
0	The polyethylene's monomer is simple and stable and it is not easy to break it and link it to another chain.
Polybutadiene has a more complex repeating cell easier to attack with a linking agent.
0	Polybutadiene repeat units have double bonds that can be used for the anion or radical polymerization between polybutadiene molecules. Polyethylene does not have double bonds and so its molecules can not be crosslinked this way. Radicals and anions will just split its molecules breaking single bonds in its units. So it is double bonds that distinguish polymers that can and can not be crosslinked.
0	When we observe polyethylene repeat unit  there is only simple carbon-carbon bonds.  But in  a polybutadiene repeat unit  we note the presence of a double carbon-carbon bond from  which it can be formed bonds between many chains.
0	Cross linking can occur when there are places on the end of  polymer that can react with a "cross linker."
Polyethylene is a repeating CH2-CH2.  Polybutadiene has a double bond of Carbon with CH2 and H radicals on each Carbon.
A cross link would be more feasible with the polybutadiene because the C=C bond would be a stronger bond to each other by an sp3 orbital than the C to the CH2 and H radicals. Because of this  the CH2 and H would  more easily form a bond with a cross-linker than a simple CH2-CH2 bond like polyethylene.
Polybutadiene  therefore  has more places to react with a cross linker than polyethylene does.

0	The repeating unit of polybutadiene has a double bond while the repeating unit of polyethylene does not. A cross-linker can therefore bind with polybutadiene - it reduces a double bond to a single bond and binds with a carbon atom - while allowing the polymer to stay bonded. The same is impossible to do with polyethylene because the cross-linker cannot bind to carbon without separating the polymer in two.
0	Polyethylene contains no reactive functional groups  polybutadiene contains a pi bond with can be opened and added to by an initiator and a nucleophile. 
0	Cross linking only occurs in molecules with multiple carbon double bonds.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross linked due to its compostion. When the double bond is broke  thesites available for linking to another polymer chain has a CH2 carbon near to it  which can take opposite direction toward another chain due to electronegativity interaction.
0	To create a cross-linked polymer  one needs a monomer that have at least two double bonds between carbons  one for starting the initiation of polymerization  and the other one for making a cross-link. That's why we can make a cross-linked polymer from polybutadiene  because it's got two double bonds  whereas there are only one double bond on polyethylene
0	Polymers such polybutadiene can be cross-linked due to the presence of double bonds in the polymer chain  which are susceptible to react with the crosslinking agent.

Polymers such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked  because the polymer chain does not contain any double bond or functional groups to react with the crosslink agent.
0	In polybutadiene  there are multiple places to form bonds there by allowing the formation of cross links. However  in polyethylene  there is just one place to form a bond. Hence  no cross linking occurs. 
0	Polyethylene has no carbon to carbon double bond in the polymer chain  while polybutadiene has CC double bond in the polymer chain. A strong base or anion can break these double bonds and starts new chains from those double bonds. This is what enables polybutadiene to be cross-linked. 
0	Linear polymers are formed when the monomer only has one possible reaction site. Cross linking occurs when there are multiple reaction sites on each monomer.
0	Polybutadiene  unlike polyethylene  has an additional carbon double bond which can be branched (and thus cross-linked) through an addition reaction. Polyethylene does not even have a spare carbon for branching.
0	Enter essay here.annot be cross-linked. Make reference to what it is about the chemistry of the repeating units that allows for the formation of cross-links. The structures for polyethylene and polybutadiene repeat units can be found earlier in the sequence questi
0	The presence of  two withdrawing groups at the butadiene monomer allows that to have two sites for connecting with other monomers in way to allow the cross-link  what is not possible at polyethlene.
0	You need to have side chains to cross link to.
0	Cross-linking requires breaking a double bond that is not at the end of a molecule to allow linking to a mid-chain carbon atom. Ethylene only has two carbon atoms  so their double bond is at the end of the chain. Polybutadiene has a double bond between its central carbon atoms that can be used for cross-linking.
0	The polybutadiene repeat unit hold a double bond which can be broken to a single bond and two isolated electrons  each one at the 2 middle carbons. These electrons can form a single bond with another butadiene repeat unit. So this unit forms a cross with can expand in 4 directions and form a net.
A polyethylene unit doesnt have a double bond. So it can only expand lineary - it forms only a chain without possibility to form a cross point.
0	Butadiene has two carbon-carbon double bonds. In polymerization process of forming polybutadiene these two double bonds allows to form not only linear structure but also form branches with monomers.  Formed branches also has extra double bond which allow pollymer to be cross-linked.
Polyethylene can't form branches because it has only one double bond and so it can form only linear structure without cross-linking.
0	Polyethylene can't be cross-linked because all carbons in the molecule are busy creating the long polymer backbone chain. In polybutadiene  however  there are some carbons in the molecule that are not part of the polymer backbone chain and are therefore available for cross-linking. These carbons can form a strong base  when a trigger substance is available to break a carbon bond and form cross-links.

0	The difference between those polymers is the existence of  functional groups. Ethylene presents a double bond  which can work as a functional group  but the pi bond is lost in the polymerization  leaving a saturated chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Polybutadiene  on the other hand  conserves a double bond even after polimerization  and the pi bond can work as a functional group for crosslinking.
0	The polybutadiene repeating unit has a double bond within it so that there are variants in subunits (cis and trans). This means the polymer chain can bend and branch more than the polyethylene chains which will be linear. The additional connectivity of the polybutadiene subunits will lead to the ability to crosslink the polymers  while the linear polyethylene chains will not.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because after the polimerization there are double bonds in the chain  which can be used in cross-linking. Polyethylene has no double bonds.
0	Because in the polyethylene the carbons are linked with hydrogens and in the case of the polybutadiene there are two methyl groups which could link with other carbons.

0	Polybutadiene in the polymerization can occur in different locations of the molecule  which gives rise to crosslinking. However  in polyethylene can only occur in one way and  therefore  does not result in crosslinking.
0	Polymers such as polybutadiene possess double bonds in the repeating unit  which allows for cross-linking.
0	Because the presence of double bonds in the polybutadiene molecules means that  during polymerization  a chain can be born from the other two chains or combined together  resulting in a branched structure.

When we observe polyethylene repeat unit  there is only simple carbon-carbon bonds.  But in  a polybutadiene repeat unit  we note the presence of a double carbon-carbon bond from  which it can be formed bonds between many chains.
0	The butadiene monomer has two double bonds which means it has more than one site for polymerization to occur. This characteristic makes crosslinking possible. The ethylene monomer has only one double bond. So there is only one place that polymerization can occur. So crosslinking is not possible.
0	Cross linking can occur when there are places on the end of  polymer that can react with a "cross linker."
Polyethylene is a repeating CH2-CH2.  Polybutadiene has a double bond of Carbon with CH2 and H radicals on each Carbon.
A cross link would be more feasible with the polybutadiene because the C=C bond would be a stronger bond to each other by pi and sp2 orbitals than the C to the CH2 and H radicals. Because of this  the CH2 and H would  more easily form a covalent bond with a cross-linker than a simple CH2-CH2 bond like polyethylene.

0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has double bonds along its linear structure. These double bonds are the sites where cross linker can react with polybutadiene.
Polyethylene hasn't double bonds but only single bonds along its linear structure. So there are no sites of interaction between cross linker and polyethylene. Thus  polyethylene can't be cross-linked.
0	Polybutadiene forms by linking many 1 3-butadiene monomers to make a much longer polymer chain molecule (cis  trans) extending to form vinyl molecules  whereas  polyethylene when highly crosslinked becomes a thermoset - elastomer.
0	The double bond in the repeating unit of polybutadiene allows for easy cross-linking possibility for polybutadiene. However in case pf polyethylene the repeating unit has all single bonds and there cannot be any easy cross linking for the polymer. 
0	Enter essay here. Polybutadiene reacts with water to crosslink ends  which is not possible with polyethylene.
0	A monomer of the polyethylene has a linear construction  so that it can provide only two points for linking: begin and end of polymer  while a monomer of the polybutadiene has a double bond besides the two bonds in begin and end of the monomer. The double bond can be destroyed providing two additional bonds  which can connect to other monomers so that each monomer has four links as against two links by the polyethilene monomer.

Ethylene has a double bond. This bond is broken when it reacts to form a polymer. There is no more possibilities to form other bond with other chain.
Butadiene has three points to form a polymer: double bond and two methyl groups at the end.
0	1 3 butadiene is CH2=CH-CH=CH2 and when it polymerised can give Polybutadiene on the form of trans 1 4 addition   1 2 addition and even cis 1 4 addition. The last addition the double bond makes bend of the chain and allows cross-linking. The same happens in the 1 2 addition  when the double bond in branch allows cross-linking. 
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked  however a polymer such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked as ethylene consists of only 2 carbon molecule which are doubly bonded to each other and when it forms an ethylene free radical intermediate  it can only form a linear molecule regardless of whether the molecule lies on x or y or z axis. It may form a zig-zag polymer but never a cross-linked polymer.
In butadiene the double bond is present at the 1 and 3 position always. The first time the intermediate may form at the 1 position and the next time it may form at the 3 position of the molecule and thereafter propogating the chain. The presence of alternate double bonds and the single bond in between the 2 and 3 carbon atoms forms the basis for cross-linking of the polymer.
0	because polybutadiene has methyl groups inaround the carbon so it will make negative and positive and it can be linked while that is not available in ethylene as it has hydrogen
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double C-C bond in one molecule of butadiene after polymerization. It can also destruct and get formation with such another. Also the vulcanization process can "sew" together the carbon atoms near the double bond by polysulfide bonds (for example -S-S-S- trisulfide bond). But polyethylene can't do this because there aren't double bonds in the polymer molecule.
0	Polybutadiene is able to be cross-linked because of its allylic hydrogen which will be substitute when cross-linking takes place. Polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because it does not have allylic hydrogen which can be substitute when cross-linking takes place.
0	Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds with other molecules. Polyethylene is a linear chain molecule without carbon-carbon double. Therefore it is not easier to make links between co-polymer molecules. 
0	The polyethylene monomer C2H4 expands in only one direction during polymerization.
The butadiene monomer C4H6 can expand in several directions  while retaining C double bond cross linking.
0	Polybutadiene is diene  it has two double bonds  and if both this binds will open it can form cross-lonked polymer. Usualy it forms linear polumer  but we can make vulcanisation using sulfur  and we can obtain rubber from it. 
 Ethylene has only one double bond and it can make linear polymer only. 
0	Polybutadiene has a C-C double bond in the repeating unit which makes it possible to be cross-linked. Polyethylene does not have a C-C double bond in the repeating unit.
0	The double bond in polybutadiene could be converted to a single C-C bond  plus an additional bond for cross-linking.
0	Polybutadiene polymer is formed from a molecule with two double bonds  in such a way that it has two possible sites to offer for linking to another unit. It can make a linear chain if it links always at the terminal sites  but it will cross-link if it bonds in an intermediate place (the second carbon). Polyethilene  on the other hand  only has one double bond  so there is only one place to connect with the next unit  and it can form only linear chains.

0	By referring to the structure of polybutadiene polymer  we found that it contains a second double bond which allows cross-linking while polyethylene contains a single bond.
0	Because the polybutadiene has in its structure two double bonds monomer that can react with branched chains  thus producing crosslinks.
0	The repeating units of polybutadiene consist of four C atoms  this units are chained through carbon 1 and 4. The two carbons in the middle are joined by a double bond. This fact allows polybutadiene to be cross-linked because this two atoms of C may "lose" the double bond  to be united by a single one  while bonding to a cross-linker molecule. 
However  this is not possible in the case of polyethylene  as the repeating unit is already formed by two carbon atoms joined by a single bond. If those were to react with a cross-linker molecule  the C-C bond would break  breaking the molecule itself.
0	Polybutadiene is a molecule with 2 double bonds. So in the reaction of polymerization  each polymer unit can be attacked in two parts of the molecule  allowing the posibility of cross-linked. On the other hand  ethylene only has one way in the reaction of polymerization. The especial stability of dienes also contributes to the posibility of cross linked
0	Polybutadiene contains carbons that have double bonds between them in the repeating units. Polyethylene only has single carbon to carbon bonds in the repeating units. 

A crosslinking agent can react with a carbon to carbon double bond in the polybutadiene to form a new compound without breaking the polymer into smaller pieces.  The crosslinking agent will have multiple sites that can react with more then one polymer chain allowing the agent to tie multiple chains together.

In polyethylene there are no double bonds to react with. Breaking the carbon to carbon single bond would require much more energy and would break the polymer into small pieces. The carbon to hydrogen bonds are not very reactive sites to try to attack with some type of crosslinking agent.


0	butadiene has 2 double bonds  during that  ethylene has only one. After polymerization butadiene  polybutadiene has one double bond  polyethylene has no. The double bond in the macromolecule of polybutadiene  gives an opportuniti for formation cross-linked bonds.
0	The difference between the formula units for polybutadiene and polyethylene is that polybutadiene has a double bond in its formula unit between two carbon atoms. Polyethylene does not have this double bond; it is just a long line of carbons with hydrogens on the side. Because polybutadiene has a pi bond  there is room in the bonds to hybridize the p orbital with a base and squeeze in another carbon  thus resulting in the cross-linkage. Polyethylene does not have this capability; one would have to remove a hydrogen entirely in order to attach something.
0	Polyebutadiene is  formed from the polymerization of the monomer 1 3-butadiene  a simple conjugated diene. Since 1 3 butadiene has two double bonds  this monomer can polymerize in two sites  and the chains can crosslink.

Polyethylene is formed from ethylene  a monomer with just one double bond. This monomer can react just with one monomer each time  and for this reason chain grows in one direction  they can not crosslink  
0	polybutadiene can be cross linked due to its compostion. When the double bond is broke  thesites available for linking to another polymer chain has a CH2 carbon near to it  which can take opposite direction toward another chain due to electronegativity interaction.

When we observe polyethylene repeat unit  there is only simple carbon-carbon bonds.  But in  a polybutadiene repeat unit  we note the presence of a double carbon-carbon bond from  which it can be formed bonds between many chains.
0	Cross-linkages require interaction between one repeating unit and another (without disrupting the polymer backbone). The strongest form of such interaction is a full covalent bond  although other interactions (eg hydrogen bonding) can also contribute. Accordingly  for cross-linking to be possible  the repeating unit must have the potential to interact with other such units.

The repeating unit for polyethylene is saturated and also has no reactive side chains (only hydrogen)  the only possible interaction with  other molecules of polymer is van der Waals forces  which are not strong enough to have any substantial impact and would not tie one such unit to a specific other one.  By contrast  polybutadiene has an unsaturated repeating unit. This allows it to form covalent bonds with other units elsewhere in the chain (or in another chain) without destroying the integrity of the polymer backbone.
0	Polybutadiene has a carbon double bond that can be broken and linked to.  Polyethylene has no bonds to easily break and link to.
0	Cross-linking require Anionic polymerization. In anionic polymerization  an active group is withdrawing an electron from the next carbon  which makes it possible for the carbon to bond to another unit.

Structures like butadiene are asimetric  which means such withdrawal and bobding is possible.

Structures like ethylene are symetrical  so the electron is not withdrawn from the carbon and the carbon cannot bond to another unit.

0	Polybutadiene includes a carbon double bond in the monomer. This double bond can be broken  allowing new bonds to form on those carbons that become the cross-linking bonds. The polyethylene monomer is formed of single carbon-carbon bonds so is unable to undergo a cross-linking reaction. 
0	polybutadiene can be cross linked because it has remaining double bonds in its structure. These bonds can be cleaved and then exploited to make cross links. Polyethylene has no such doble bonds
0	because polybutadiene has two double bonds while polyethlene only has one.
the function of two double bonds is just like the bridge  which enable them to cross linke
0	Polybutadiene can be cross linked because it contains methyl which can for links with other monomers when they are in contact with an initiator or a substance which will enable them to bend whereas  Polyethylene does not have any methyl groups it just contains hydrogen which has a full subshell and it can not form anymore bonds.
0	It cannot be cross-linked naturally due to their structure after polymerization. There's no double bond to be attacked...In the polybutadiene theres a double in the middle!

0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it's molecular structure allows it to connect to it's link and not just the ends as in plyethylene and polybutadiene.
0	In the butadiene monomer   the number of possible conenction is 4 ( >2) because of the 2 double bonding .
so monomers can be added in 3 different ways where the reticulation .
Unlike ethylene monomer   the number of possible conenction is 2  ( only one double bounding )   so there will be no reticulation .

So in order to make reticulated polymer   we use generaly monomers with 3 or more fonctional groups or some mothods like sulfur vulcanisation for inter-chaine conenction " case of caoutchouc"
0	polybutadiene allows the formation of cross-links because of the CC double bond.
0	polymers that can be cross linked have multiple places to react  while the ones that don't only have one place to react  forming a chain.
0	Polybutadiene has a flexible  asymmetric structure  which allows multiple bonds of various sorts in multiple directions  while polyethylene has a more regular  stable structure  limiting bonding.
0	the Polybutadiene repeat unit contains a double bond which can react and form a crosslinked bond  while the Polyethlene repeat unit contains no double bond and thus can only form a linear polymer
0	Polybutadiene have doble bounds  wich can polymerizait
0	It is clear from the repeat units that polyethylene repeat unit allows only 2 connections. However polybutadiene repeat unit allows more than those  giving the abilty to other molecules to interact with different places in the repeat unit
0	When the reaction is initiated by breaking the double carbon bond in polybutadiene  the resulting repeating units are identical.  They mesh together as they become crosslinked.  The bonds are irreversible.  Polyethylene has a free carbon radical in each of its repeating units.  Each carbon radical seeks a new bond and keeps the reaction going.  This means that polyethylene will not become crosslinked because the bonds formed are not irreverisble.
0	Repetion unit of polybutadiene having two double bonds  and therefore can be used to create a double bond the polymer and another to intersect each other. However  the repeating unit of polyethylene only has one double bond and form the polymer is crosslinked.
0	The explain is that a polymer polybutadiene have two double bond and a polymer polyethylene have a single bond thereby can't form a cross-linked  only can form a lineal polymer
0	The structure  where the double bonds are placed. Also seeing if the polymer is carbon based or not.
0	Cross linking requires breaking a bond to provide bonding sites at multiple places in the molecule. In polyethylene  you could only break CH bonds  which wouldn't provide a suitable linking base. In polybutadiene  you could break the CC bonds.
0	polyethylene is composed of a a repeating structure which contains only single carbon bonds  there is no double bonds to enable the addition of of a radical and cross-linking; additional ethyl groups can only be added at the ends. But polybutadiene does contain double bonds  which causes mean that it can be cross-linked because there are locations other then the ends where structures can be attached.
0	In order for cross linking to occur  there has to be multiple points for the polymerization to initiate.  Since the polyethylene polymer is made from a molecule with no possible isomers  there is only one unit can be formed  whereas the polybutadiene can be formed from cis or trans isomers resulting in different possible sites and different branches.  
0	Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds. But in the case of polyethylene this property is missing. 
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it contains carbon-carbon double bonds. These double bonds can be converted into a single bond and a cross-link. Polyethylene only contains carbon-carbon single bonds  so there is nowhere to form the cross-links.
0	Butadiene has two C=C double bonds Polybutadiene is a polymer made by addition polymerization of Butadiene monomer or repeating units.Because of two C=C double bonds in monomer they are capable of forming crossed linked polymers.Where as Polyethylene is a polymer made from polymerization of ethylene monomer  having one C=C double bond.Monomers are joined together along the axis of their double bond  forming a long linear chain of carbon atoms containing single bond between C- atoms  that is why they do not form cross linked polymers as against the Butadiene monomer which form cross linked polymer. 
0	The carbon polymers  such as polyethylene  consist of C-C bonds along the backbone. The C-C bond length is small: about 1.54 angstroms  and there is not enough room for a radical to replace one of the hydrogen atoms along the sides of the backbone.

The polybutadiene polymer consists of siloxane  or Si-O-Si bonds along the backbone. The distance between the silicon atoms is twice the Si-O bond length  or much greater than the C-C bond length  so now there is room for a hydrogen to be replaced by a radical that can form crosslinks between two polymer chains.
0	The polybutadiene monomer is larger than the polyethylene monomer and it has more carbon=carbon double bonds. In fact polybutadiene has two double bonds while polyethylene has only one. Polymerization is possible by using initiator to withdraw electrons from the double-bonds and create new bonds with the initiator and subsequently with other monomers of the same type. 

Polybutadiene repeating units have three sites that can be opened up for connection  while polyethylene has only one. So  when connecting one monomer to another the only geometry possible with polyethylene is a long continuous linear chain. Polybutadiene with three connectivity sites can connect is a more random fashion with other monomers: the connections can cross between the same pair of monomers or join with others  creating a 3D chaotic pattern of cross-linked chains.
0	polyethylene is composed of a a repeating structure which contains only single carbon bonds  there is no double bonds to enable the addition of of a radical and cross-linking; additional ethyl groups can only be added at the ends. But polybutadiene does contain double bonds  which means that it can be cross-linked because there are locations other then the ends where structures can be attached.
0	because polybutadiene  are easily dissolved  in solvents

0	butadiene has two carbon double bonds  whereas one can be used to linear polimerization  forming fibers  and the second one can be used to make cross-links  whereas ethylene has only one double bond  wich alows only linear polymerization
0	Polybutadiene can be a cross-linked because it has more than two carbons  so there are a double carbon-carbon bond  and single carbon-carbon bond. Polyethylene does not have such opprotunity because it has only double carbon-carbon bond.
0	The repeat units of polye
0	More branched which leads to worse packing. Less branched leads to better packing. 
0	polybutadiene is a product of the polymerization of 1 3-butadiene  so that it has two double bonds while polyethylene is a product of polymerization of a polymer chain etileno.Es linear unbranched. The polyethylene may form a three-dimensional network when subjected to a covalent reaction of vulcanized (cross-linking)
0	because of long chain and possess twice number of double bond or conjugation polybutadiene can be crosslinked
0	Polybutadiene contains a carbon-carbon double bond in its repeating unit  which can be split to allow for the formation of more links to other monomers. Polyethylene  on the other hand  is a linear chain containing only carbon-carbon single bonds
0	Enter essay here.It happens because requires at least two double bonds in a molecule to crosslink happen
0	The presence of double-bonds in polybutadiene structure allows for the formation of cross-links. Polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because it has a saturated backbone. 
0	polybutadiene contains a double bond which can make cross links  polyethylene does not 
0	The compound polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has two places where the reaction can occur  otherwise the polyethylene don't can be cross-linked because it has just one place to react.
0	Ethylene by itself has a double bond. But   on polymerization   it becomes a very long hydrocarbon with just single bonds between the carbon atoms. This leaves the carbon atoms with no provision to form any more bonds and hence no provision for cross links.

But   in the case of butadiene   there are two C-C double bonds. On polymerization   one double bond remains in the repeat unit. This can be utilized by the respective carbon atoms for cross-linking between different chains.
0	PB can be crosslinked because the polymer contains double bonds which can be broken by a radical to form a new bond.   With the correct amount of broken bond  PB chains next to each other can form crosslinking bonds - typically with S.
PE can't do this because it is saturated.
0	A peroxide in the polyethylene will not let the polytthylene molecules to crosslink.
0	PE only has H at it's boarders. No C-C Bond can be made here. Whereas polybutadiene has sidegroups containing C thus making it possible to form cross links.
0	Polyethylene only has two carbons to react with  each of which will be the ends of the repeating unit during a polymerization reaction  so there are no possibilities for cross-linking; all the carbons will be used to make a chain.

Polybutadiene has possible sites of cross-linking in its second and third carbons.
0	A cross link is a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds with other molecules. Polyethylene is a linear chain molecule without carbon-carbon double. Therefore it is not easier to make links between co-polymer molecules. 
0	polyethyline has a unique double bond that is used to build the poylmer structure and the repeat unit.
Instead  in the motif of poly butadiene  it still exists a second double bond that  could be use to create new link to other molecule

When polyethylene foams  all the Carbon-Carbon double bonds are broken  resulting in a backbone of the polymer that is all single carbon bonds. When the polybutadiene is formed the backbone of the polymer has a Carbon-Carbon double bond for every 4th bond between the carbon atoms. These bonds can be broken in order to form another bond. These bonds can form between chains. 
0	Polybutadiene has multiple sites basic ionic sites available for bonding.  Polyethlyene has one site available for bonding.  Crosslinking requires multiple sites on a molecule to have bonds created with other molecules.
0	Enter essay here. Butadiene  CH2--CH-CH--CH2  has four carbons and two double bonds. The polymerization can occur by adding the first carbon of a molecule to the fourth carbon of the preceding molecule  in which case the molecule will be linear  or by adding the first carbon of a molecule to the second carbon of the preceding molecule  leaving a branch and allowing cross-linking. The simpler polyethylene  CH2--CH2  has only two carbons with a single double bond  so no branches can be formed.
0	Polyethylene has only one functional group and hence cannot be crosslinked. Polybutadience on the other hand two functional groups and hence can be crosslinked
0	As polybutadiene has 2 hydrogen atoms plus the 2 CH2 groups it can be cross-linked through the H position but the polyethylene has no positions where it can be cross-linked
0	The polyethylene has a straight chain structure with thermoplastic characteristics.
Polybutadiene is soft and doughy 
through crosslinking  by vulcanized  the  linear chain  structure passed  to tridimensional chain
their caracersticas  improve
0	Polybutadiene has a carbon-carbon double bond as part of the backbone that can participate in addition polymerization to form cross-linked polymers.  Unfortunately  polyethylene does not have any degrees of unsaturation in the backbone  thus prohibiting it from participating in any further polymerization.
0	Simply put  Polybutadiene is a diene polymer  that is  it's a polymer made from a monomer that contains two carbon-carbon double bonds  which aids cross linking. Unfortunately  polyethylene is a just a straight chain single bond all polymer
0	No idea.

0	Polybutadiene withdraws electron density (due to the double bonds) while polyethylene doesn't. Therefore  polyethylene cannot be cross-linked.
0	Because butadiene has 2 doubled bonds and he can be crosslinked unlike ethylene
0	The presence of the anion or strong base to react with the polymers. In poylbutadiene the double bond create a electron pull away from the hydrogen and allow the hydrogen leave the polymers and form a strong base.
0	Enter essay here.it is because of bonds.carbon in the polybutadiene can be cross linked whereas the carbon in the polyethylene cant be cross linked.
0	according to polybutadiene monomer  there is a carbon-carbon double bond in monomer. So  when initiator added  we have one carbon in radical form to make cross-link with other chains. However; according to polyethylene monomer such a double bond can not be found.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked as there is a carbon-carbon double bond which can be attacked by a linking molecule.  Polyethylene lacks such a carbon-carbon double bond.
0	A polymer like polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double bond in its repeat unit which can be broken  allowing bonds to form between two polymers. However  polyethylene doesn't have any available bonds off of the carbon atoms in its repeating unit to connect one polymer to another  so it cannot be cross-linked.
0	Polyethylene has no carbon to carbon double bond in the polymer chain  while polybutadiene has CC double bond. A strong base or anion can break these double bonds and starts new chains from those double bonds. This is what enables polybutadiene to be cross-linked. 
0	It is possible for butadiene to form more than one "point of union" with the polymer chain since it has two different double bonds. Because of this  single chains of polybutadiene can also join between them to form a cross-linked polymer.

On the other hand  ethylene only has one double bond to form the polymer.
0	It is a polybutadiene is termoset
0	Because of the lack of a cross-linking site. 
0	The repeating unit for polybutadiene is 1 3-butadiene  which contains two C-C double-bonds. Both of the double-bonds in the repeating unit can be broken  which provides two opportunities for a potential reaction with a cross-linking molecule. By contrast  polyethylene's repeating unit is ethylene  which contains only one C-C double bond  and thus only one reaction possibility for a potential cross-linker. However  cross-linking requires multiple reaction possibilities for repeating units to be able to be tied together in a cross-linked network.
0	The Polybutadiene repeating unit has double-bonds that allow for the polymer chains to form in a variety of ways(cis trans etc.)  depending on which orientation the additional monomers will bond to the polymer chain. Since the repeating unit has a double-bond  it can also react with other polymer chains to create the cross-links. 

Polyethylene  on the other hand has a repeating unit that has a single Carbon bond along the backbone  which prevents the polymer chain from having the multiple ways of forming like polybutadiene(it will have a more linear construction)  and the lack of the additional double-bond prevents it from cross-linking effectively to other chains  since there are no additional bonds that can be easily created to join them.
0	In order for cross-linking to occur  the monomer must have at least two functional groups (e.g. C=C bond) that are able to polymerise. Butadiene has two double bonds  meaning that any given monomer is able to link to two other monomers  producing a cross-link. Ethylene has only one double bond  meaning that each monomer can link to only one other monomer  producing a linear chain.
0	For a polymer to form cross-linkage  there should exists some substance or the monomer itself that can form bond with more than one polymer chain.

Consider polybutadiene  its monomer is butadiene which as two carbon-carbon double bonds. Each of them can bonded to different (or the same but twisted) polybutadiene chains. We can see that  beside increasing in length by adding butadiene at the head or tail of an existing polybutadiene chain  polybutadiene can have branches which are the cross-linkages.

However  for polyethylene  its monomer  ethylene  only has one carbon-carbon double bond. This allow ethylene attaches to one polyethylene chain only  at the head or tail of the chain  instead of form the cross-linkage.
0	Polybutadiene has several double Carbon bonds and Polyethylene has not. 
0	Polybutadiene has a structure that allows it to create four links in one of its molecules.
polyethylene has no such four links  just two.
0	polybutadiene has a double bound  and in pressence of water splits in acids  so it glues together the ends of polymers acting as an elastomer.
0	butadiene has two double C-C bonds which give two ways to grow of polymer and which cross between of themselves
0	Feedback not yet available. Reload to check again. Once the problem is graded  this message will be replaced with the grader's feedback
0	Can't be cross linked as uses up double bond when creates polymer so nothing left to cross link
0	polybutadiene is a product of the polymerization of 1 3-butadiene  so that it has two double bonds while polyethylene is a product of polymerization of a polymer chain etileno.Es linear unbranched. The polyethylene may form a three-dimensional network when subjected to a covalent reaction of vulcanized (cross-linking). Crosslinked polymer chains are held together by covalent bonds (polybutadiene)  while non-crosslinked polymer chains are bound by weaker secondary interactions (polyethylene) .
0	polyethylene cannot be crosslinked because of the lack of elements other than hydrogen attached to the double-bonded carbons. In order for crosslinking to occur there must be available bonding areas for chains of polymers to attach to  thereby interlinking the various ethylene molecules  and forming an extremely viscous 'fluid'. However  polybutadiene does have carbons bonded to the double-carbon pair in the center of the molecule  providing the necessary bonding areas required.
0	Polybutadiene can be crosslinked because  after the polymerization has begun  the to-be-added monomer can go to the end of the chain or actually break the double bond of the previously added monomer  thus creating two new places for the next monomer to add to; if repeated  many ends will link  rendering a cross-linked polymer.

On the other hand  ethylene only has one double bond; so  after being broken  the next to-be-added monomer has no other place to attach to  which will create a linear  non-cross-linked polymer.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because the repeat unit of this polymer have more than one reactive center  so they can form more than one chain of polymer. This allows the creation of cross-links.
On the other hand  the polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because the structure of the repeat unit is linear  so the bonds can only be form in one direction.
0	Enter essay here.
polybutadiene can form various branched structures due to the presence of 4 carbon atoms whereas however arranged polyethylene can form only linear structures and hence cannot be crosslinked.cross linking is only possible if the hydrocarbon polymer contains branching.
0	Polyehtylene cannot be cross-linked as its monomer (ethylene) has only one pi bond  so when activated by a radical or a base the radical becomes attached to one side while the other becomes a radical to activate another monomer an so on. It can only be linear.
While in polybutadiene there's two pi bonds  the radical or the base is attached to one bond forming linear chains as in polyethylene but remains another bond that can be broken by an activator to connect another chain in the same monomer (cross-link).
0	Poly butadiene forms triple carbon bonds  and becomes a set plastic material. Polyethylene does not.
0	Because polybutadiene has two double bonds in its structure and because of that it can be linked in the begining as well as in the end of the polymer.
0	cause polybutadien obtain extra double bond which is preserved after polymerization process and which polyethylen does not have. due to that  this extra bond enable polybutadien to make crosslinked product
0	the basic difference between the two polymers is that butadiene has two double bonds while ethylene has just one single bond. therefore butadiene has more bonds that can be cross-linked than ethylene.
0	Polybutadiene  unlike polyethylene  has an additional carbon double bond which can be branched (and thus cross-linked) through an addition reaction. polyethylene does not even have a spare carbon for branching.
0	Due to the presense of a double bond  polybutadiene can be cross linked. 
0	The repeat unit of the polybutadiene has a double bond that there is not in the polyethylene structure. This double bond allows polybutadiene chains react with a molecule of butadiene or with other chain to form a crosslinked structure
0	Cross-linking depends on anionic polymerization. Polybutadiene can form an anion  polyethylene can't.
0	The double carbon bond in polybutadiene allows it to be cross-linked.  In polyethylene there is only a single carbon bond which does not allow for cross-linking.  The double carbon bond allows for the carbon to carbon bond to still be held if one of the two bonds is broken.  Going from a double bond to a single carbon bond lends an additional bond available for another atom on the polymer  hence the ability to cross-link.
0	The cross linking process needs a functional group such as double bond in order to make bonds between two or more chains of polymers.
The polyethylene do not have reactive group  it has only C-H or C - C groups  but polybutadiene  has doble bonds to make bonds between polymer chains with the help of the  crosslinker.
