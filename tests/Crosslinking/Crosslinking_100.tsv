0	A polymer in order to be cross-linked need to be able to branch.  Polyethylene has only one double bond and thus has only one way to attach the additional "mer". The resulting structure is a linear chain.
Butadiene on the other hand has 2 double bonds. if both these bonds are used to attach the next "mer" a branch is created this way  resulting in a cross-linked structure.
0	Polybutadiene has double bonds which is available to other ligants to form cross-links. On the other hand  in polyethyleno there are not such double bonds
0	The polybutadiene repeating unit has a double bond within it so that there are variants in subunits (cis and trans). This means the polymer chain can bend and branch more than the polyethylene chains which will be linear. The additional connectivity of the polybutadiene subunits will lead to the ability to crosslink the polymers  while the linear polyethylene chains will not.
0	Polymers such as polybutadiene possess double bonds in the repeating unit  which allows for cross-linking.
0	We need different places to connect
0	A cross-link is generally when a polymer is chained(linked) to another polymer. For polymers to be cross linked it has to have a bond which can sacrifice an electron to form another bond  such as double bonds and triple bonds. Single bonds however do not have any way to sacrifice an electron to form a link. In polybutadiene the C=C bond inside the repeating unit is why it can form cross links with other polymers while in polyethylene a C-C bond exists which is unable to form any bonds(links) with another polymer due to the insufficiency of electrons to form bonds.
0	Polyethylene has only one functional group and hence cannot be crosslinked. Polybutadience on the other hand two functional groups and hence can be crosslinked

cross-linking requires covalent bonds.
0	Polyethylene will form a linear chain due to the molecular alignment and the tetrahedral nature of the bonds.
Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it can form bonds at multiple points in the molecule.
0	I think polyethylene would not be cross linked because the monomer of polyethylene is ethylene/ethene  and it only has one site for reaction  just one double bond and it is linear  so even if something were added it would keep the chain linear. Unlike polyethylene  the monomer for polybutadiene  1 3-Butadiene   has two double bonds. Due to this  there are two sites where other monomers can join  as well other compounds. For example  when Butadiene is used to make tire rubber  sulphur is used for crosslinking  the sulphur can add at one monomer site on one chain of polybutadiene and link it to another.
0	Cross-linking depends on anionic polymerization. Polybutadiene can form an anion  polyethylene can't.
0	Polyethylene has no carbon to carbon double bond in the polymer chain  while polybutadiene has CC double bond in the polymer chain. A strong base or anion can break these double bonds and starts new chains from those double bonds. This is what enables polybutadiene to be cross-linked. 
0	Cross linking can occur when there are places on the end of  polymer that can react with a "cross linker."
Polyethylene is a repeating CH2-CH2.  Polybutadiene has a double bond of Carbon with CH2 and H radicals on each Carbon.
A cross link would be more feasible with the polybutadiene because the C=C bond would be a stronger bond to each other by pi and sp2 orbitals than the C to the CH2 and H radicals. Because of this  the CH2 and H would  more easily form a covalent bond with a cross-linker than a simple CH2-CH2 bond like polyethylene.

0	Butadiene contains two Carbon to Carbon double bonds. This provides each molecule with four sites for (polymerisation) attaching to other molecules. The molecules can therefor polymerise across as well as along their length.

Ethene has only one Carbon to Carbon double bond and can therefore attach to two other molecules (compared to four for Butadiene). No cross linking is therefore possible on polyethylene.
0	1 3 butadiene is CH2=CH-CH=CH2 and when it polymerised can give Polybutadiene on the form of trans 1 4 addition   1 2 addition and even cis 1 4 addition. The last addition the double bond makes bend of the chain and allows cross-linking. The same happens in the 1 2 addition  when the double bond in branch allows cross-linking. 
0	It is a polybutadiene is termoset and has covalent bonds  and polyethylene has ionic bonds.

polybutadiene can form various branched structures due to the presence of 4 carbon atoms whereas however arranged polyethylene can form only linear structures and hence cannot be crosslinked.cross linking is only possible if the hydrocarbon polymer contains branching.

they are three types of solid polymers: elastomers  thermoplastic polymers  and
thermosetting polymers. Elastomers are rubbers or rubberlike elastic materials.
Thermoplastic polymers are hard at room temperature  but on heating become
soft and more or less fluid and can be molded. Thermosetting polymers can
be molded at room temperature or above  but when heated more strongly
become hard and infusible. These categories overlap considerably but are
nonetheless helpful in defining general areas of utility and types of structures.
The structural characteristics that are most important to determining
the properties of polymers are: (1) the degree of rigidity of the polymer molecules 
(2) the electrostatic and van der Waals attractive forces between the
chains  (3) the degree to which the chains tend to form crystalline domains 
and (4) the degree of cross-linking between the chains. 
Consider a polymer made of a tangle of molecules with long linear
chains of atoms. If the intermolecular forces between the chains are small and
the material is subjected to pressure  the molecules will tend to move past one
another in what is called plastic flow. Such a polymer usually is soluble in
solvents that will dissolve short-chain molecules with chemical structures
similar to those of the polymer. If the intermolecular forces between the chains
are sufficiently strong to prevent motion of the molecules past one another the
polymer will be solid at room temperature  but will usually lose strength and
undergo plastic flow when heated. Such a polymer is thermoplastic. A crosslink
is a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Crosslinks
are extremely important in determining physical properties because they
increase the molecular weight and limit the translational motions of the chains
with respect to one another. Only two cross-links per polymer chain are required
to connect all the polymer molecules in a given sample to produce one
gigantic molecule. Only a few cross-links  reduce greatly the
solubility of a polymer and tend to produce what is called a gel polymer  which 
although insoluble  usually will absorb  solvents in which the
uncross-linked polymer is soluble. 
0	A monomer of the polyethylene has a linear construction  so that it can provide only two points for linking: begin and end of polymer  while a monomer of the polybutadiene has a double bond besides the two bonds in begin and end of the monomer. The double bond can be destroyed providing two additional bonds  which can connect to other monomers so that each monomer has four links as against two links by the polyethilene monomer.
0	The carbon polymers  such as polyethylene  consist of C-C bonds along the backbone. The C-C bond length is small: about 1.54 angstroms  and there is not enough room for a radical to replace one of the hydrogen atoms along the sides of the backbone.

The polybutadiene polymer consists of siloxane  or Si-O-Si bonds along the backbone. The distance between the silicon atoms is twice the Si-O bond length  or much greater than the C-C bond length  so now there is room for a hydrogen to be replaced by a radical that can form crosslinks between two polymer chains.
0	The structure  where the double bonds are placed. Also seeing if the polymer is carbon based or not.
0	because polybutadiene  are easily dissolved  in solvents

0	polyethylene is composed of a a repeating structure which contains only single carbon bonds  there is no double bonds to enable the addition of of a radical and cross-linking; additional ethyl groups can only be added at the ends. But polybutadiene does contain double bonds  which causes mean that it can be cross-linked because there are locations other then the ends where structures can be attached.

0	From the procedure of polymerizing ethene we can see that polyethylene can be  a  line of CH_2 (lines ending with CH_3) without any double bond at all.  On the other hand polybutadiene has one double bond on each unit which is repeated to create a polymer molecule. So  the active base (initiator) during the polymerization of butadiene can 'attack' a growing chain of polybutadiene at any double bond in it creating cross-links.
A polyethylene can be only a line of ethene units.

0	Cross-links are possible only if a polymer unit (a monomer molecule) has more than one double bonding. Additional bondings allow the molecule to be a part of more than one polymer chains which is the esssence of cross-links. Ethylene has only one double bonding  so it can't be cross-linked.
0	Butadiene has two C=C double bonds Polybutadiene is a polymer made by addition polymerization of Butadiene monomer or repeating units.Because of two C=C double bonds in monomer they are capable of forming crossed linked polymers.Where as Polyethylene is a polymer made from polymerization of ethylene monomer  having one C=C double bond.Monomers are joined together along the axis of their double bond  forming a long linear chain of carbon atoms containing single bond between C- atoms  that is why they do not form cross linked polymers as against the Butadiene monomer which form cross linked polymer. 
0	Because polybutadiene is produced by anionic procedures and polyethylene by addition procedures
0	The units that are linked in polybutadiene are very weak and hence easily gets reduced so that it can be cross-linked. However the bond is quite strong in ethylene or polyethylene and hence it is not easily reduced  thus preventing cross leading.
0	Because the polybutadiene has in its structure two double bonds monomer that can react with branched chains  thus producing crosslinks.
0	In order to create cross-linkages  monomers must be able to polymerise with more than two other monomer molecules. Alternatively a  cross-linker with the property of binding to more than two other molecules must be included. A monomer that can only link to two molecules will simply lengthen the molecule without branching.

Ethylene has a double bond. This bond is broken when it reacts to form a polymer. There is no more possibilities to form other bond with other chain.
Butadiene has three points to form a polymer: double bond and two methyl groups at the end.
0	By referring to the structure of polybutadiene polymer  we found that it contains a second double bond which allows cross-linking while polyethylene contains a single bond.
0	Polybutadiene includes a carbon double bond in the monomer. This double bond can be broken  allowing new bonds to form on those carbons that become the cross-linking bonds. The polyethylene monomer is formed of single carbon-carbon bonds so is unable to undergo a cross-linking reaction. 
0	The polybutadiene is a polymer  trifuncional  have three covalent bonds and can from 3D networks  in change  the polyetilene is a polymer linear formed by bifunctional monomer units.
0	Because ethylene has only one double carbon-carbon bond. In contrast  butadiene has two double carbon-carbon bonds. So one of them is used to form the link between monomers and the other to create CROSS LINKS
0	Polyethylene polymer consists of -CH2-CH2- cycles  which are saturated and there are no reaction centers in the middle of cycle and due to that cross-linkers don't easily bond with polyethylene.
Polybutadiene polymer consist of -CH2-CH=CH-CH2- cycles which aren't saturated and due to this they have reaction centers where cross-linkers can easily bond with polybutadiene
0	Butadiene has two carbon-carbon double bonds. In polymerization process of forming polybutadiene these two double bonds allows to form not only linear structure but also form branches with monomers.  Formed branches also has extra double bond which allow pollymer to be cross-linked.
Polyethylene can't form branches because it has only one double bond and so it can form only linear structure without cross-linking.
0	Ethylene  C2H2C2H2 has only two sides  so the only polymerization possible when breaking the double bond will be linear
Butadiene can have a double bond located in different places  which will create more options for crosslinking
0	Etylene has only one double bond which is used up during the polymerization  meaning repeat units can only be added to the end of a long chain 
Butadiene also builds up a chain like etylene  however there is still another double bond left in the repeat unit after reaction  which can react again with a repeat unit at a later point in time to give a side-arm to the polymere chain. This side-arm can then also continue to grow  arc more  etc. etc.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked as there is a carbon-carbon double bond which can be attacked by a linking molecule.  Polyethylene lacks such a carbon-carbon double bond.
0	It is a polybutadiene is termoset and has covalent bonds  and polyethylene - ionic bonds. 
0	It is possible for butadiene to form more than one "point of union" with the polymer chain since it has two different double bonds. Because of this  single chains of polybutadiene can also join between them to form a cross-linked polymer.

On the other hand  ethylene only has one double bond to form the polymer.
0	Cross-linkages require interaction between one repeating unit and another (without disrupting the polymer backbone). The strongest form of such interaction is a full covalent bond  although other interactions (eg hydrogen bonding) can also contribute. Accordingly  for cross-linking to be possible  the repeating unit must have the potential to interact with other such units.

The repeating unit for polyethylene is saturated and also has no reactive side chains (only hydrogen)  the only possible interaction with  other molecules of polymer is van der Waals forces  which are not strong enough to have any substantial impact and would not tie one such unit to a specific other one.  By contrast  polybutadiene has an unsaturated repeating unit. This allows it to form covalent bonds with other units elsewhere in the chain (or in another chain) without destroying the integrity of the polymer backbone.
0	Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because the repeat unit of this polymer have more than one reactive center  so they can form more than one chain of polymer. This allows the creation of cross-links.
On the other hand  the polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because the structure of the repeat unit is linear  so the bonds can only be form in one direction.
0	Polybutadiene is a molecule with 2 double bonds. So in the reaction of polymerization  each polymer unit can be attacked in two parts of the molecule  allowing the posibility of cross-linked. On the other hand  ethylene only has one way in the reaction of polymerization. The especial stability of dienes also contributes to the posibility of cross linked
0	PB can be crosslinked because the polymer contains double bonds which can be broken by a radical to form a new bond.   With the correct amount of broken bond  PB chains next to each other can form crosslinking bonds - typically with S.
PE can't do this because it is saturated.
0	When we say the fracture of the c-c double bond  we mean the breaking of the pi bond  leaving the two carbons bonded by a single sigma bond.

The Polybutadiene monomer has two c-c double bonds  but the polyethylene monomer has only one c-c double bond.

the C-c double bond allows the monomer to enter into a polymer: as it fractures it two carbons each with a single unpaired election.  The single unpaired election allows the carbon to bond with another carbon (provided that carbon also has an unpaired election).  Hence the fracturing of the c-c double bond allows for the formation of two new bonds.  A monomer can join with two other monomers: each of those monomers can join with an additional monomer  and the polymerization can occur.

Polybutadiene has two c-c double bonds  hence it can undergo two separate polymerization processes  joining together two otherwise separate polymers.  And each monomer present can enter into polymerisation with two separate polymers: each monomer can cross link between two polymers.  Hence each polymer can be cross linked with many different polymers  and there can be a high degree of cross linking.
0	Polybutadiene in his monomer unit have double bond which allow him to be cross-linked to another polybutadiene by interaction of p bonds while polythyene in his structure have only single bonded carbon  so it could not be cross-linked.
0	The polyethylene's monomer is simple and stable and it is not easy to break it and link it to another chain.
Polybutadiene has a more complex repeating cell easier to attack with a linking agent.
0	The repeat units of polyethylene only contain one double bond and can therefore only form chains. 
The repeat units of polybutadiene contain two double bonds (diene) that allow cross-linking in cis  trans and vinyl connectivity. Trans bonds keep the polymer straight  whilst cis bends the polymer.
0	Polybutadiene have doble bounds  wich can polymerizait
0	Butadiene has two double bonds and only one needs to be broken to form ploybutadiene. The polymer has carbon-carbon double bonds which can be broken and used to form cross links.

Ethylene has a single carbon-carbon double bond. Once polyethylene has been formed   via the breaking of the double bond  there are no double bonds remaining and no way to form cross-links.

0	Polybutadiene has a carbon-carbon double bond which can be broken to accommodate an anionic inhibitor to initiate anionic polymerization  allowing it to form cross-links. In the case of polyethylene  there is no carbon-carbon double bond within the repeating unit of ethylene itself  thus preventing anionic polymerization from taking place. 
0	Polyethylene's structures does not allow for cross linking because it is very linear in structure. The polymer can grow on either ends and does not leave double bonds for the repeating units to form cross-links with. Polybutadiene on the other hand does allow for cross-lining because of the double-bond which remains with each of the repeating units.
0	-
0	The repeat unit of the polybutadiene has a double bond that there is not in the polyethylene structure. This double bond allows polybutadiene chains react with a molecule of butadiene or with other chain to form a crosslinked structure
0	Due to the presense of a double bond  polybutadiene can be cross linked. 
0	This is the answer.
0	polybutadiene allows the formation of cross-links because of the CC double bond.

0	Polybutadiene is diene  it has two double bonds  and if both this binds will open it can form cross-lonked polymer. Usualy it forms linear polumer  but we can make vulcanisation using sulfur  and we can obtain rubber from it. 
 Ethylene has only one double bond and it can make linear polymer only. 
0	butadiene has 2 double bonds  during that  ethylene has only one. After polymerization butadiene  polybutadiene has one double bond  polyethylene has no. The double bond in the macromolecule of polybutadiene  gives an opportuniti for formation cross-linked bonds.
0	Polymers such polybutadiene can be cross-linked due to the presence of double bonds in the polymer chain  which are susceptible to react with the crosslinking agent.

Polymers such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked  because the polymer chain does not contain any double bond or functional groups to react with the crosslink agent.
0	In the butadiene monomer   the number of possible conenction is 4 ( >2) because of the 2 double bonding .
so monomers can be added in 3 different ways where the reticulation .
Unlike ethylene monomer   the number of possible conenction is 2  ( only one double bounding )   so there will be no reticulation .

So in order to make reticulated polymer   we use generaly monomers with 3 or more fonctional groups or some mothods like sulfur vulcanisation for inter-chaine conenction " case of caoutchouc"
0	
When we observe polyethylene repeat unit  there is only simple carbon-carbon bonds.  But in  a polybutadiene repeat unit  we note the presence of a double carbon-carbon bond from  which it can be formed bonds between many chains.
0	Polyethylene does not cross link because it has no double bonds between carbons so the polymer chain has only one arrangement of the atoms.  Polybutadiene has double bonded carbons that can break and reform in different arrangements which allows for the molecules to cross link.
0	The polybutadiene has two centers where it can build chains with other radicals or starters 
0	the second double-bond in the case of polybutadiene
0	polyethyline has a unique double bond that is used to build the poylmer structure and the repeat unit.
Instead  in the motif of poly butadiene  it still exists a second double bond that  could be use to create new link to other molecule
0	In order to support cross-linking  it must be possible for the polymer chain to be branched (so that there are places for the cross-links to anchor).  In carbon-based chains such as polyethylene and polybutadiene  this requires the presence of a double-bond somewhere in the repeating unit that can be opened up to provide two single bonds - one to support the continued presence of a polymer chain  and the other to join with the cross-linking unit(s).   Polybutadiene possesses such a double bond  and can therefore be cross-linked  but polyethylene does not.  In polyethylene  the original double-bond in the ethylene monomer is fully used up in forming the original polymer chain.
0	From the procedure of polymerizing ethene we can see that polyethylene can be  a  line of CH_2 (lines ending with CH_3) without any double bond at all.  On the other hand polybutadiene has one double bond on each unit which is repeated to create a polymer molecule. So  the active base (initiator) during the polymerization of butadiene can 'attack' a growing chain of polybutadiene at any double bond in it creatinf cross-links.
A polyethylene can be only a line of ethene units.
0	polybutadiene can be crosslinked because of its double bonds. Polyethylene cannot be crosslinked because each c-atom is sp3 hybridized ad tetrahedral.
0	polybutadiene can be cross linked because it has remaining double bonds in its structure. These bonds can be cleaved and then exploited to make cross links. Polyethylene has no such doble bonds
0	Polyebutadiene is  formed from the polymerization of the monomer 1 3-butadiene  a simple conjugated diene. Since 1 3 butadiene has two double bonds  this monomer can polymerize in two sites  and the chains can crosslink.

Polyethylene is formed from ethylene  a monomer with just one double bond. This monomer can react just with one monomer each time  and for this reason chain grows in one direction  they can not crosslink  
0	Polybutadiene has double bonds and has no double bonds
0	
In Cross-linking polymerization one polymeric chain gets connected to the other through a bond which can be covalent or ionic.  
In the case of polyethylene  the monomer ethylene molecule contains one c=c double bond which is used for the addition polymerization. Since there are no extra double bonds or branches in the polyethylene chain it cannot undergo cross-linking polymerization. 
While in the case of polybutadiene  the monomer is a conjugated diene  1 3 butadiene.  1 3-butadiene has two c=c double bonds and  even after polymerization  there exists one C=C double bond between the 2 3 carbon atoms   in each repeating unit of the polymer  which allows further polymerization leading to cross linking.  1 3-butadiene can undergo polymerization in different ways  like  1 4-addition in cis and trans forms allowing bending in the chain. The existence of the double bonds in the chain permits branching and thus to cross-linked polymers. 
Those polymeric chains which contain repeating units with branches can easily undergo cross-linking polymerization. Also the presence of double or triple bonds are also provides a good chance for the polymeric chains to get cross-linked. In addition to this the presence of functional groups in the polymeric chains can also help in cross-linking between the chains leading to the change in property of the polymer. For example a polymer in liquid state can be converted to solid through cross-linking. Soft rubber can be hardened through vulcanization. Bakalite is another good example of cross-linked polymer.

0	Butadiene  the monomeric unit of polybutadine contains two double bonds.  A reaction (such as an addition) can occur at one of these double bonds.  If this happens many times a polymer will form.  There will still be many double bonds present where reactions can occur cross-linking these units together.  In polyethylene there is only one double bond between two carbons.  Once the polymer is formed the -H2C-CH2- unit is repeated leaving no place for cross-linking to occur.
0	Poly butadiene forms triple carbon bonds  and becomes a set plastic material. Polyethylene does not.
0	It cannot be cross-linked naturally due to their structure after polymerization. There's no double bond to be attacked...In the polybutadiene theres a double in the middle!

0	Enter essay here. Butadiene  CH2--CH-CH--CH2  has four carbons and two double bonds. The polymerization can occur by adding the first carbon of a molecule to the fourth carbon of the preceding molecule  in which case the molecule will be linear  or by adding the first carbon of a molecule to the second carbon of the preceding molecule  leaving a branch and allowing cross-linking. The simpler polyethylene  CH2--CH2  has only two carbons with a single double bond  so no branches can be formed.
0	Polybutadiene contains a double bond in each repeat unit  which can be attacked by an anion. This anion (a so called 'cross-linker')  then effectively acts as a bridge between two different polymer strands (or another double bond in the same strand). Thus a cross-linked polymer is formed.

Polyethylene contrasts in that it has no double bond in its repeat unit  so no sites are available for a cross-linker to join.
0	In order for cross-linking to occur  the monomer must have at least two functional groups (e.g. C=C bond) that are able to polymerise. Butadiene has two double bonds  meaning that any given monomer is able to link to two other monomers  producing a cross-link. Ethylene has only one double bond  meaning that each monomer can link to only one other monomer  producing a linear chain.
0	Polybutadiene has a double bond  due to which it can form a cross-linked polymer. 
Polyethylene hasn't this double bond. Hence it can't be cross-linked.
0	The polybutadiene repeat unit hold a double bond which can be broken to a single bond and two isolated electrons  each one at the 2 middle carbons. These electrons can form a single bond with another butadiene repeat unit. So this unit forms a cross with can expand in 4 directions and form a net.
A polyethylene unit doesnt have a double bond. So it can only expand lineary - there is no possibility to form a cross point.
0	Polybutadiene has a C-C double bond in the repeating unit which makes it possible to be cross-linked. Polyethylene does not have a C-C double bond in the repeating unit.
0	The polybutadiene repeat unit hold a double bond which can be broken to a single bond and two isolated electrons  each one at the 2 middle carbons. These electrons can form a single bond with another butadiene repeat unit. So this unit forms a cross with can expand in 4 directions and form a net.
A polyethylene unit doesnt have a double bond. So it can only expand lineary - it forms only a chain without possibility to form a cross point.
0	In polybutadiene  there are multiple places to form bonds there by allowing the formation of cross links. However  in polyethylene  there is just one place to form a bond. Hence  no cross linking occurs. 
0	Because butadiene has 2 doubled bonds and he can be crosslinked unlike ethylene
0	PolyButadiene can form crosslinks due to the presence of not one but two double bonds. Polyethylene has only one double bond so can only form one dimensional polymers.
0	Polyethylene has only single bonds  polybutadiene has a double bond where it can form cross-links
0	To have a cross-linked polymer  there must remain double bonds in the polymer chain. This doesn't happen in the case of polyethylene  but it happens to polybutadiene:
 
 (- CH2 - CH2 )- n                                        (- CH2 - CH = CH - CH2 )-
 polyethylene mer                                         polybutadiene mer
0	Crosslinking is a process of linking one polymer chain to another polymer chain. Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because butadienes have conjugated diene (two carbon-carbon double bonds). As the butadienes polymerized in a straight chain by trans or cis double bond  there are some double bond branches left over as a result of 1 2- addition polymerization. The double bonds in the branches allow the cross linking to happen by linking to another polybutadiene chain. 

However  polyethylene does not have such double bonds to allow cross linking to occur. Addition reaction cannot be performed. 
0	Repetion unit of polybutadiene having two double bonds  and therefore can be used to create a double bond the polymer and another to intersect each other. However  the repeating unit of polyethylene only has one double bond and form the polymer is crosslinked.
0	Polyethylene has no carbon to carbon double bond in the polymer chain  while polybutadiene has CC double bond. A strong base or anion can break these double bonds and starts new chains from those double bonds. This is what enables polybutadiene to be cross-linked. 
0	In order for cross linking to occur  there has to be multiple points for the polymerization to initiate.  Since the polyethylene polymer is made from a molecule with no possible isomers  there is only one unit can be formed  whereas the polybutadiene can be formed from cis or trans isomers resulting in different possible sites and different branches.  
0	Butadiene has two sites to which additional units can be attached  allowing connection to existing polymers  closed loops  and interlinked structures.  Initiated ethylene can only extend from one end  permitting only unidirectional extension of the structure.
0	The presence of the carbon-carbon double bond in the repeating unit of polybutadiene allows carbons from two different polymer chains to form a crosslinking bond when that double-bond is broken.

The saturated structure of polyethylene means that the formation of these crosslinks is impossible (unless  perhaps  the substance is imparted sufficient energy to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds).
